32,King of budget phones,"Box includes:Phone, Data cable, Soft transparent back cover, wall power adapter and user manual.Pros:+ Super smart phone+ Excellent build quality+ Gorgeous display+ Very good rear camera with DSLR grade bokeh, it is one of the best under 25K.+ Sleek, sturdy and very premium+ One of the best selfie in the market under 25K.+ No heat, no lagging.+ Dual band WiFi+ Smooth performance from SD-636 coupled with 4GB RAM.+ Great connectivity package - 4G, Dual SIM, FM Radio, WiFi+ Above average sunlight legibility.Cons:- No Oreo out of the box.- No NFC- Protruding camera lens- Average speaker loudness.I don't see any mobile as good as this under 18K except last year's Huawei flagships Huawei P9 and Honor 8, Samsung Galaxy S7 & Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1.Huawei phones have better cameras, better display, same performance and NFC and better low light photography but with smaller display size and and no FM.S7 has better display which vivid and more punchy, double resolution, superior camera, 4K video recording, better low light photography and Samsung Pay.Zenfone Pro Max 1 has better display, better sunlight legibility, better battery life, better speaker, equally good camera and quick Android update. Easily recommended under 18K.",5.0

52,Review & tricks to get phone on flash sale,"Its a very good phone for this price range. The black variant of this phone is too good. Had compared with other color which friends has & black variant is really looking exceptional. And for people who are finding it difficult to order the phone in flash sale, I have  small tips for you. Usually flash sale get started at 11.59 and with in seconds it gets over. But what i did is, i kept on refreshing again and again for another 30 min and the product got pops up again. I got the phone available for checkout at 12.18 PM.So keep on refreshing the page for at least 30 min. You will get the phone. If it is getting added to cart and you was not able to check out, don't remove from the cart as its easy to refresh the cart page again and again and the moment continue button gets enabled click it.Another Tip : If you are able to add to cart and not able to check out.. Don't remove it from cart. Let it be there till next flash sale and it will be easy for you as its already in the cart. You just have to wait and keep of refreshing your cart.Happy purchase. :)",5.0

I have to wait for 3 weeks.Front colour is white, That should be blue too.One Have to use back cover for the safety of the rear camera lenses.Overall I will give 8 out of 10.",5.0

The Technical guys who visited my house spent 5 min of time and play some Youtube videos and decides that the handset is working fine they don't use any tools they don't run any diagnostics to check the issue and they will be ready to close the case by showing that technical person has helped to solve the issue. After killing 10 days when i have reported the same thing they have come up with an answer that your 10 days time has passed and your are not eligible.",1.0

99,Worth the money,"Phone is perfect now at this price bracket without any competitors around as companies own MI A1 permanently discontinued. Coming to verdict- my opinion the phone should be priced at 13000/- during launch. As first few batches come impoted from China henceforth the price. Made in China with manufactured during January. So the question arises how Mi sold 3 lakh phones actually they have not. As always the screen has lots of stack/dead pixels, not really noticed unless you are in full brightness and full black screen. Coming to camera quality - front camera quality has improved a lot. Back camera can take decent photos in daylight. Lowlight & indoor shots are unusable. EIS in video is outstanding.Amazing battery life no heating issue. Don't worry if you cannot buy during first few sales just try next time.",4.0

SD 636 with 4GB of RAM and adreno 509 GPU, is super fast and handles all graphics heavy game easily. 9.5.13 update brings oreo and dual 4g so that's cool. Charging time 2.5hrs. Cameras are very much capable and produces some very good pictures in good lighting conditions. Low light photography is hit or miss. Biggest disappointment is video. EIS works wonders but 1080p video doesn't look like fhd video and lacks details and seems washed out. Front camera is also very good.Overall a very compelling package but could have been priced 13,000‚Çπ. At 13k this would have been super value for money offering. Xiaomi can price this 15k because of negligible and incompetent competition in this price range. You can still blindly go for it.",5.0

153,Excellent,"Hi,I also purchased this phone after reading most of the Ratings after 1st sale and by watching different videos on YouTube. These Ratings are given as per my fulfillment of Expectations.Positive points:1. Looks = 9/10 (one point less as I prefer 5-inch display. Though its 6 inches but it screen to body ratio make it look classic) 2. Camera = Rear 09/10; Front 10/10 (Added thing is it has front flash)3. Ram = 4 GB- 10/10 (Normal use of RAM is 45-50%) so you will always find 50% RAM available (You don't have to clean every-time as system does it Automatically, this is also + Point)4. ROM = ~53 GB for use from 64 GB (For me 32 GB was also enough) so 10/105. Processor = 10/10 (for me Quad core was also enough) as I am not gamer.6. Battery = 10/10 This is because battery backup was my main expectation and till time it hasn‚Äôt disappoint me. (+ point is this phone is having battery saving option, which add one more feather on points)7. Software = 10/10. As I am light-moderate user, but the software and the options given in this phone is awesome. within this price range it‚Äôs almost impossible to get all those features. (+ point for face unlock)8. Connectivity = 10/10. As this is VoLTE phone so I do not require to have separate calling app for making calls from Jio number. Call clarity as great on Both SIM.Lacking points:1.	I could not find Pinch to Zoom function while reading text messages.2.	Single color for all notification.3.	No head phones in BOX.4.	No separate slot for SIM & Memory card (For me I don‚Äôt have too much issue)5.	Still searching.Some people has given this product 1-2 star by saying Made in China product (it‚Äôs their choice after all), but let me tell you that, it‚Äôs MADE IN INDIA product. Some has given low rating because of C-Type port is not given. But I don‚Äôt find any advantage of having C-Type, rather I find it as disadvantage as your phone is not compatible for all other Micro port.

154,Great phone except it wasn't exactly brand new (Spots).,"I have owned this phone for 6 days.Flipkart delivered it within 24 hours, Cheers to that.First thing is that the camera is awesome and usually the first clicks are enough for a good picture. Selfie flash does a manageable job in complete darkness.Loudspeaker is sufficiently loud.Display is flawless and even in mid-day direct sunlight, it is clearly visible.Audio output is a bit low via headphone jack.Call quality is good and no network drops so far.Ram struggles only when I open 3 high end games at a time.It's slim and build quality is good.MIUI is feature-rich and I have been using a new theme everyday.Charging time is 2 hours and I must tell that for a day of minimal usage with 1.5 to 2 hour screen on time, a half an hour charge is more than enough. I tried to kill the battery within 1 day and started at 100% when it was 10:00am. I kept the brightness to the max, GPS on high accuracy, WiFi, 4G, Bluetooth were on all the time. I played games for more than an hour and screen on time was 5 hours +. At the end of the day at 10:00 pm, I managed to get it  to 5% and I must say this is a great feat achieved by the phone. I am a hardcore user and I had almost given up on discharging it completely by the end of the day.I had been a big fan of Xiaomi but this is my first Xiaomi phone. The only problem was that I received the phone with a noticeable scratch and two spots in the back which I could not afford to report and return for a replacement as I need a phone.",5.0

171,Excellent,"WHY YOU SHOULD BUY THE NOTE 5 PROThere 5 simple reasons why this phone should be on your shopping list right now.1. Brilliant Design and DisplayXiaomi is good at making dazzling phones like the Mi Mix 2. Taking cues from some of its best phones till now, Xiaomi has designed the Redmi Note 5 Pro. This phone features a sturdy build comprising a metal unibody and Corning Gorilla Glass protection at the front.No, the phone is not waterproof. However, at the given price of Rs 16,999 for the 6GB RAM variant, it is a good-looking smartphone, complete with slim bezels and an 18:9 aspect ratio. Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-5-Pro-20The display on offer is a 5.99-inch Full HD+ resolution unit that sports an IPS LCD screen. However, some might debate that the phone is tipping towards the heavier side with 181 grams of total weight. Well, I'd say that with a 4,000mAh battery, this phone just trying to justify the extra bulk by offering a longer run time.The fingerprint sensor is also placed comfortably at the back and is not out of bounds even for smaller hands.2. Brand New Qualcomm Snapdragon ProcessorIt's that the processor is the brain of a phone and the Redmi Note 5 Pro has the best brain in the entire price range. Adorned with the brand new the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 with custom Kryo 260 cores, this phone promises almost 59% faster performance than its predecessor, the Redmi Note 4.Coupled with a massive 6GB of RAM, another great offering in this price category, this phone comes as a complete package. You can easily forget about laggy performance and longer app loading time.Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-5-Pro-18If you do not wish to spend extra bucks, then you can always opt for its cheaper 4GB version with the same processor.3. Best In-class CamerasAnother feather in its cap is the dual camera at the back. Although it does look like a straight copy of the iPhone X camera module, the performance of this camera speaks a lot for itself.Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-5-Pro-3First up, you get EIS or electronic image stabilization for videos. And secondly, you also get automatic low-light image enhancement achieved using the PDAF sensor. There is a lot you can do with the Note 5 dual camera. Its hidden features are a treasure trove that you should definitely check out.Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Camera SpecificationsRear Camera	5MP Samsung depth sensor+12MP Sony IMX486 sensorFeatures	1.25 ¬µm Large Pixels, LED flash, PDAFEIS	YesSelfie Camera	20MP Sony IMX376 sensorFeatures	1.12¬µm Large Pixels, LED flash4. Overheating Protection SystemHeat is one of the biggest enemies of modern smartphones. It results in lowered performance and could also sour user's experience. To counter this issue, Xiaomi has introduced a dual-thermal design based overheat protection system with the Redmi Note 5 Pro.This comprises of two sheets of pyrolytic graphite sheets that help dissipate heat from the processor and other components and directs it towards its metallic body. It acts as a radiator and helps lower the device's temperature by 2¬∞C.Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-5-Pros-cons-2This is something that Xiaomi has been working on since last year and the Redmi Note 4 also came with a pyrolytic graphite. However, it was only limited to one place, at the back of the device.5. Love for Selfies The Redmi Note 5 Pro is nothing but good news for the selfie lovers. It comes with a moonlight selfie flash, which is essentially meant to brighten your selfies in low light. It's placed right beside the front camera.Xiaomi-Redmi-Note-5-Pros-cons-3The front camera lets you take shots in the portrait mode or get the elusive bokeh effect. Despite the fact that there is just one camera at the front, this phone manages to achieve this effect using software-based enhancements. It's pretty close to the real deal.",5.0

187,Super!,"I have been using this phone for 25 days now... & frankly speaking I am quite amazed by the overall performance of this phone. To begin with Flipkart delivery was fast. I bought this during the MI 4th anniversary sale & didn't face any problem getting this phone in stock. Was delivered within 3 days. I was waiting since long for the launch of launch Nokia x6 but now I am glad that I didn't wait any longer. To begin with 1) The build quality is good. Though it has the same metallic back as for all redmi phones, I am using it with the soft plastic case provided within the box and it looks very premium with the cover which gives it a shiny glassback type look (I have the black model). 2) The touch and display is awesome. Touch feels smooth and though it is an IPS LCD display the colors are very punchy, specially when seen from a direct angel. With the 18:9 aspect ratio the display looks very cool. 3)Processing speed is nice, though PUBG is not available is extreme graphics and HDR ON but it runs pretty smoothly. I am nt much of a mobile gamer, so for daily activities like surfing, whatsapp, youtube this processor is far more than enough. 4) Battery is 4000 mAH. Nothing extraordinary specially if u have already used a Redmi phone before. With moderately heavy usage (gaming, surfing, youtube, calls) the battery will last for about 24hrs. But on the other hand it charges fast also. Though a lot of ppl complained that it doesn't have a USB-c port and we arn't provided with a fast charger in the box, I found even with the stock charger it charges in about 2.5 hrs from 15% to 100%. So can't complain about that. 5) Now coming to the focus point of this mobile - the reason everyone is buying this phone - THE CAMERA. The camera is 5/5, specially considering the price point. I have taken a few samples which I have attached (all the photos are unedited/no postprocessing with 3rd party app/software). The camera really shines in Day/Bright light photography. The portrait mode is also superior to many of the much costlier phones. In portrait it uses a linear algorithm which gives a very natural DSLR type bokeh effect. The best part is even without the portrait mode u can get the blurring effect if the focus subject is very close to the camera which is because of the aparture f2.0. Though the colors are a bit dull in normal photos (compared to oneplus 6 or honor phones) but u can easily add a filter while taking the photo which makes the colors pop out. Coming to the front camera, it has one of the best front camera that I have seen. If u are a selfie addict then u are in for a treat. The beauty mode makes ur skin look smoother and overall gives a dreamy look to the pic (which makes it look a little unnatural at times). It also has a dedicated front camera flash which makes it very handy if u are taking selfie at low light (in a nightclub or in streets). The low light photography is not that good in this camera (back or front) with a lot of noise (but isn't that the case with almost all the budget and even some flagship phones) . But a simple solution to that is - Select the manual mode, set ISO to low level (somewhere between 100-400 depending upon the situation), and use the flash. By using flash it can take superb photos even in dark surroundings. The videos quality is not good at all as the contrast is poor and everything looks dull and washed out. If u plan to take a lot of videos then this phone is not for u. 6) I have heard a lot of ppl complaining about the OS but just after 3days of buying I got the Oreo 8.1 update and I really like the MIUI 9.5 that I am using now. It is highly customizable and using different themes and 3rd party apps (no root needed) u can get different looks. (for example I am using a custom Pixel 2 launcher and live wallpaper that gives a very clean stock android type experience)...... Apart from the above mentioned points other things are ok in this phone... Sound output is good, speaker loudness and clarity is OK, screen doesn't catch a lot of smudged/scratches (Though a screen protector is absolutely recommended) etc. In conclusion this is a very good value for money phone specially if you like to take a lot of photos (portrait and normal). There are other phones in the market which has one or other qualities better than this phone but Redmi Note 5 pro ticks all the right boxes which makes it the budget king that it is today. If your budget is around 15K and you like taking photographs, go for this 'jack of all trades'.",5.0

229,Worth every penny,"In a market as competitive as the Indian smartphone market, every company strives to achieve the number one position. But what happens once they achieve it? Ever since Xiaomi joined Samsung as the top-selling smartphone in Indian smartphone market at the end of Q3 2017, as per IDC, it was only a matter of time the Chinese company took the title for itself.And that‚Äôs what has happened. According to the latest figures from IDC, Xiaomi has been crowned the king of the Indian smartphone market beating the chaebol during the fourth quarter of the year 2017, creating a certain pressure on Xiaomi to remain the leader. It‚Äôs one thing reaching the top but to sustain it is a totally different ball game. Perhaps that‚Äôs why Xiaomi has been a bit quieter than other brands. While others have made a lot of noise about launching new handsets, all this time Xiaomi was sitting tight. We‚Äôre in the second month of the year and Xiaomi has finally decided to launch its products in India, which are going on sale tomorrow for the first time.Among all the launched products -- the Redmi Note 5, Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Mi TV 4 -- recently, here we are going to talk about the Pro edition of the newly launched Redmi Note 5. The India launch marks the global entry of this device which comes with certain features worth your attention such as a completely new Snapdragon 636 processor, the 20MP front camera and a dual rear camera setup, because of which, the company is calling it ‚ÄòIndia‚Äôs camera beast. Redmi 5 Pro Design and DisplayGiven the obsession of the smartphone world with the 18:9 aspect ratio of the display Xiaomi too has incorporated this for the Redmi 5 Pro. But this isn‚Äôt the first Xiaomi phone to come with a bezel-less design in India as it had introduced this feature with its flagship device the Mi Mix 2 last year. However, with the Redmi 5 Pro, now it won‚Äôt burn a hole in your pocket. Due to the bigger display, the capacitive keys are now on-screen keys.The front is as usual dominated by the display along with the selfie camera, earpiece and the usual array of sensors on the top edge, with a layer of 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass on the top with rounded display corners. The curves make the phone easy to hold and facilitate smooth operation, despite sporting a 5.99-inch screen size.Turn the smartphone around and you will first see a vertically placed iPhone X like rear camera setup, where the LED flash is housed in between the two lenses. Frankly, this is not the first time when an Apple design feature has made its way to other smartphones. Remember when the dual rear camera setup of the iPhone 7 Plus was unveiled, how many handset makers got ""inspired"" by the design?Moving on, the back panel also has a centrally placed fingerprint sensor and the Mi branding below it. The handset comes with a micro-USB charging port (we fail to understand why) that is placed at the bottom, along with 3.5mm audio jack and the mono speaker. There's a volume rocker and power button on the right, while the left side has a SIM card tray. The top of smartphone has the IR blaster that lets it control devices such as a TV.Coming to the display, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro has a 5.99-inch screen with a FHD+ resolution of 2160x1080p. The display comes with features such as Reading mode, which reduces the blue light emissions; Schedule that lets you customize the period of this reading mode; Contrast and colour selection and text size options. The images were quite sharp and we did not see any pixelization. The sunlight legibility is not one of the best suits of the device and we also felt the display looks slightly dimmer, when viewed from a certain angle.Overall, we can say we did not have any complaints with the slim body design and is definitely going to grab some attention, even if it‚Äôs just for the rear camera panel.Performance and cameraLet‚Äôs talk about the specs of the device as it comes with a noteworthy feature. Debuting along with the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Pro is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, making it the first smartphone in the world to be powered by it. This new chipset features the newest Kyro technology, claimed to be seen in the 800-series chipset. Apart from this, the Note 5 Pro has 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage.The device runs Xiaomi's MIUI 9 skin based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, and should hopefully receive an Oreo-based update as all major launches of this year now are expected to come with the latest operating system. The MIUI 9, like the typical Xiaomi UI, has no app drawer and therefore all apps are placed on multiple home-screens. It comes with an app lock feature and dual apps space customized theme option. The leftmost home screen comes with quick cards that show the frequently used features and information. It is placed in the form of cards, similar to Today's page in iOS, that show shortcuts, calendar, take a note and more. This can obviously be customized as per the user and comes in quite handy once you start depending on it.One thing that we must point out is that even though the handset has a third-party theme support, these apps are not yet optimized for the 18:9 aspect ratio of the display. There is a blank black patch that comes on the lock screen if you select any app and it surely gets on your nerves after a point. When we asked Xiaomi about this, they said, ""Starting this month, all official themes from Mi India will be adapted to 18:9 aspect ratio. Also, third-party theme developers are being pushed to adopt their themes for 18:9 phones.""In short, right now you get only two native themes that are fully supporting the display.We ran Antutu and GeekBench 4 tests on our device. While the phone scored 100031 in Antutu Benchmarks, the single-core and multi-core scores on GeekBench 4 were 1772 and 4227 respectively.During our testing, we found the overall performance of the Xiaomi Note 5 Pro to be simply incredible. The phone handled multi-tasking of random app in a smooth lag-free way. We did not encounter any frame freezing of any kind. Both the call quality and the Audio quality are also quite good. The issue persists with the speaker placed at the bottom as the sound gets muffled when the device is placed in a landscape mode.The Xiaomi Redmi 5 Pro is backed by a 4000mAh battery that easily lasted us for more than a day of average use that included playing games and browsing social media apps, with Wi-Fi turned on.Moving on to the cameras, the Xiaomi Note 5 Pro comes with a -- iPhone-look-alike -- dual rear camera setup of 12MP+5MP RGB sensors. The primary 12MP camera has a 1.25¬µm sensor and a f/2.2, while the secondary camera has 1.12¬µm sensor and f/2.0. As per Xiaomi, the secondary camera comes in handy for depth sensing in the portrait mode as well as capturing 'additional information' in low-light shots. On the front, the device a whopping 20MP camera, not seen something on a Xiaomi device before. This front camera comes equipped with Beautify 4.0 AI algorithm and a dedicated selfie-light, clearly marking its move to capture the selfie-crazed generation of the country.The camera app is pretty simple with options to make a video, a short video (it is preset to 10 seconds), capture a picture in square mode, portrait mode, panorama and manual mode. It also has native Instagram-like filters for the users.In our experience, the camera of the smartphone is excellent. The colours were sharp and true to the actual shades. The Bokeh effect was also bang on where the camera was able to completely focus on the foreground. Even the selfie camera will amaze you with the precision of its Bokeh effects. Also, the beautification feature surprisingly looks realistic rather than making one look like an anime character. The otherwise perfect front camera just falls short of capturing detailed low-light images. But overall, the Note 5 Pro does stand up to the camera beast tag it comes with.VerdictThe Xiaomi Note 5 Pro is hands down a great phone. It has a powerful processor and a good camera, not just on paper but in experience as well. The FHD+ display in an 18:9 aspect ratio is an added perk. The device comes in two storage variants of 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage at Rs 13,999, which is dirt cheap for the kind of specs it offers.There is also a 6GB RAM variant that comes at Rs 16,999, making it the first Xiaomi Note phone to have 6GB RAM variant. Personally, we feel, 4GB will be enough for a casual user, but for those who want extra, even this variant doesn‚Äôt qualify as over-priced. With so many things going for it, it‚Äôs hard but to not absolutely recommend the Note 5 Pro. Competition better up their game as Xiaomi with Note 5 Pro clearly has",5.0

254,Does the job,"Got this in 1 minute in last Flash Sale :) I bought it mainly for its SD636 processor & Camera setup. Here's my honest review:CONS first because the list is longer :(1. Display: Text Sharpness & Readability is very poor. Even the colours are not vibrant. Viewing in direct Sunlight is pathetic. And the back key & menu buttons don't show up at times.2. Software: Till now I thought if Hardware is good then software is not that important but Redmi proved me wrong. The software on this phone is so pathetic that you just won't get happiness using this phone forget customisations (and I'm saying this after using the Lenovo K5 Note for 1¬Ω yrs). Most in-built apps cant even be disabled. Tip: Go for Stock Android One phones even with a lower processor.3. Weight: It is very heavy & you'll realise within 5 mins of using it for texting or watching videos.4. Screen Cast/Mirror just doesn't work. Mostly it doesn't connect, even if it does the video will be jerky & sound will be poor quality.5. Video Capture is not good as it is jerky during movement. Not expected from a 15k phone. Even my Lenovo K5 Note didn't have this problem in Full HD video.6. Notification led is very small & just one colour. Even my Lenovo K5 Note had 2 colours (orange while charging & blue for notifications).PROS:1. Still Camera is good in good lighting conditions & with good blur effect (but sometimes edge detection is not good). At night, it is poor as any other low cost phone.2. Audio quality via Headphones or Bluetooth is superb. And speaker volume is quite loud for music & ringtones (but you can't set a separate volume for Ringtone & Notifications).3. Processor is good but long messages on WhatsApp make typing very slow (maybe it's a WhatsApp or Keyboard software issue).I had to change from Lenovo K5 Note only because it used to hang b'coz of it's Mediatek processor but the Software, Ram Management, Dolby audio, Display, Screen Mirroring, etc were way superior than this even when it costed cheaper.As expert reviewera have said - Note 5 Pro with Stock Android One would have been a killer flagship phone. But this one - is NOT.",3.0
255,Really Nice,"Pros: 1 : good camera quality in this price segment and front camera is amazing,2: good bettery life ,3: good crispy display,4: front side design is pretty good but back side is traditional mi style,5: powerful processor no lags .6: face unlock available in OTA update.Cons: 1: hybrid SIM slot.2: Ram management was not so good.Overall this phone is amazing in this price segment.",5.0

279,Highly recommended,Redmi is going to a different level with good price to performace ratio.

Handset2. Charger (5V, 2amps)[ A fast charger must be given with this model, but they provide only 2Amp charger but still gives a very fast speed of charging ]3. USB charging cable(very short & seems very low quality(design), but gives a very good speed of charging)4. Sim ejector pin5. A transparent soft case[ Thanks to Xiaomi , almost saved my 300 Rs.(original Mi soft cover) ]Design:It looks very decent. The design of the phone is not great but not bad as well. I like the 2.5D glass on the front which gives it a premium look. The phone is slightly taller than Redmi Note 4 but the width is a bit smaller. It is easier to hold because of the smaller width but due to extra length, it will be difficult to hold it through one hand to go to the top of screen. Overall the design is good and I would give it 7/10.Display:The display is large 5.99 inch with 18:9 aspect ratio and Full HD+ resolution. The display is beautiful and sharp. The viewing angles are good and it is sufficiently bright for read properly under sunlight. Display Rating: 8.5/10Sound:The sound output from speakers is excellent. The speakers are loud and clear. Xiaomi has made great improvement here compared to previous Redmi Note 3 and Note 4.The sound output from 3.5mm headphone jack is good. Tip: Use sound enhancer in settings to improve sound quality.The call quality and clarity was great as well both on earphones but might be some echo with speakers(I hope this will be resolved in next some updates).Battery:The battery lasted for 1.5 days with medium to heavy usage. SOT( Screen On Time) was more than 8 hours which is excellent. 10/10Camera:12MP+5MP Dual Rear Camera Pictures are really great and can comete with Oneplus 5T. Pictures have plenty of details and very sharp. Portrait mode is awesome. 20MP Front Camera with FlashGreat pictures & beautify effect works well. The front camera also has a portait mode and gives a nice blur effect. Front flash was useful in low light conditions and improved selfie quality.Processor:Snapdragon 636 chipset latest and 1st phone with it. Just unreachable in processing and gives a tough compition to others under 15000 price range phone.Face Unlock:Face unlock is awesome. It registered face data very quickly. it is working great. I tried it with 2-3 other people and they were not able to open the phone. It is quick(unlocks in less than a second.) Overall, Redmi Note 5 Pro is an excellent value for money device with good looks, great camera, long battery life, powerful chipset. I don't think we will see a better smartphone under 15000 this year. Go for it if your budget is 15000.Thanks for reading. Please upvote if the review was useful.",5.0

Otherwise it will go out of stock in seconds. Now, coming to the phone. The phone is no doubt the best phone in this price range. I ordered 4gb variant and the rose gold color luks beautiful ! The storage is enough and the camera definately shots nice pictures with good focus. Front 20mp camera is best for selfie lovers. Battery life is also good.

294,Wonderful,The best camera phone in this segment. The dual camera with potrait mode is so awesome that the pictures taken on it looks as if taken in a dslr.The front camera too is very promising as it too has a potrait mode in it. The 18:9 displays gives a unique gaming experience and the face recognition is quite satisfactory. The black colour variant looks absolutely stunning with its mind blowing front screen. There is a camera bump which can be covered by using a good case. also there is lack of fast charger in the set eventhough the phone supports fast charging. Another slight con is the phone sometimes gets heated whwn we play huge games like pubg but also note that the heating was not too worse as it cools down fast and the heatimg is only upto 35 degrees maximum. Overall i was pretty satisfied with this note 5 pro as it gave me  maximum value for the money eventhough its very hard to catch hold of it during flash sales.,5.0

Display looks similar to galaxy s8's display due to bezeless screen...!!Pros: Hand feel is amazing, size of the phone is large still doesn't feel huge due to right ratiosBokeh mode is one of the best by far... Font camera is 20 mp and what added to it is potrait mode in front.Xiaomi bottom single firing speaker:Have very fine precision sound but its should be lil louder. Only one cons : Heating issues while charging hope xiaomi Fix this in next updateI wanted to give 5 stars bt xiaomi's in box quality is not soo good...

Very much impressed.Now about the phone.I m using the device for the last 3 days and following are my observations.Pros:1. Price - Got it in almost 8k after exchanging my old mi note 4. Super cheap deal.2. Display - Bright, crisp, sharp. No notch is added bonus. Notch is so irritating.3. Camera - best Mi camera till now. No shutter lag at all. Portrait mode is just awesome. Even front camera is great. Selfie flash is fun too.4. Battery - As usual, excellent battery backup. Absolutely no need to carry a charger. Charging speed is also better than previous mi phones.5.UI - So much user friendly. You can customize almost everything. Hell lots of themes, wallpapers and fonts. You can hide on-screen navigation keys too. Volume and power off button have so much other functions too. 6. Ram management - Almost 2 fb free from 4gb ram most of the times.7. Dual apps is there.8. Split screen is present.9. Finger print sensor is very fast.10. Face unlock is great too.Now about negative points, not much though.Cons: 1. No stock Android experience, plenty of pre installed apps, though u can uninstall them.2. Top and bottom chins are little too much broad.3. Camera struggles in low light, which is a concern for camera enthusiast.4. No fast charging.5. No dedicated memory card slot.6. No headphones provided though it's a 15k phone.That's it for now. I hope you will find this review helpfull. Thanks for reading.",5.0

384,Delightful,"I am going to review REDMI NOTE 5 PRO after using it for 10 days.Undoubtedly, Redmi has done a great job by bringing one of the best budget phones with the most striking features.Additionally, keeping the competition high in market for smart phones. Pros :1. Attractive look and color variants.I purchased the Lake Blue and it looks beautiful.2. Good battery back up.3. Great picture quality for both rear and front as well.4. Portrait mode is impeccable.5. Display is good, not great(but then what more could you have asked for in a budget of 15K/17K).6. No heating problem even using when phone is put to charge.Cons :1. Camera efficiency reduces in low light. Portrait mode becomes almost futile.Low light camera efficiency can be improved.2. I was not quite impressed with the display, Could have been better.Note : Initially there was problem with the volume using earphone. These are fixed with the upgrades.So to conclude, its a great buy with a pocket friendly budget and the minor cons can obviously be skipped considering the budget. One of the best budget phones of 2018.Highly recommended.",4.0
385,Simply awesome,"Got this phone after trying 4 to 5 times but dont have complaint now. Best phone in the budget.

I did photo shoot on this phone and i am so happy with the results. No one was believing that the images are from note 5 pro mobile. Camera 10/10  Front camera is just awesome. The portrait mode is just amazing. I compared the picture quality with Iphone 7 and its the same. Back camera is also good.Audio 10/10  Loud audioProcessor 10/10Everything is best.Full Paisa Vasool.Only bad thing is flash sale.

435,Good quality product,"first of all i'm not really into MI's, but bought this for my bro,initial impressions were gud,Really gud cameras especially selfies and portraits are coming out really nicely, EIS is there but sadly no 4K video recording even after the oreo update, that's really a bummer. Phone handles everything in a very smooth manner, no complaints regarding the processing power, ram management is gud,MIUI is flawless, display is really nice and crisp, 4000mah battery will last one day easily but no fast charging support i tried it with moto turbo charger but no use, speaker is loud enough, having all the sensors including IR blaster but i think most of the people are not gonna use it, overall it is a great device BUT practicality it is NOT, Because even though it have a 64gb memory on board its a hybrid solution, this is really annoying for most of the dual sim users coz they have to ditch their memory cards to put the second sim, there is no proper dual 4g volte, though its having a sd636 processor it is not the fastest, this are reasons y i choose zenfone max pro over note5pro, so if you are looking for a great camera oriented device just go for it, but if you are looking for a no nonsense device zenfone max pro will serve you better,it is slightly faster, display is slightly better, larger 5000mah battery and it will support fast charger,dedicated slots, stock android O out of the box and next 2 android updates will be available, rear camera is similar to the note 5 pro in most of the lighting conditions,4K UHD is there but no EIS and slow motion, front camere is average, no gorilla glass..",4.0

443,Flash Sales,"The price was 14,000 before and then Xiaomi took a weird decision to INCREASE the price by 1000 to 15,000! On the top of that,  flash sales makes very hard to buy this. Coming to the phone : the phone is nothing special. Everything is normal and just works.Design is plain boring. SD 636 is that biggest and only positive point of this phone. The cameras are under average, Huawei and New Samsung phones can outshine the cameras easily.  The charger is very slow,  even though the phone supports quick charge, mi provided normal charger to cut cost. Screen size is good but contrast and sharpness is bad compared to my Samsung on max. Hybrid SIM slot is a very big inconvenience. (Kudos to Huawei for not following this suite)Data speed, voice over call quality and signal reception are good. Conclusion: nothing special. you can buy 10000-13000/- honor phones and get better camera and separate sim slot.  or buy new Samsung phones put 32gb sd card and get better quality. ASUS max also is better then this except camera. Seriously, 15000 is too much for this phone.  Maximum 13000 would have been reasonable. I'm planning to returning this.",1.0

466,Worth every penny,+ Awesome Display Resolution+ True camera Beast - camera quality is good in low light compared to Mi A1. The best part with MIUI 9 is erasing tool in a photo editor.+ Excellent Battery backup+ Fingerprint response is so quick+ Performace higher than what you expected+ 4GB RAM so that you won't feel laggy. For a normal user at any time 50% of RAM is available + Out of 64 GB of Internal Memory you may get Approx 54GB of free Space. so there is no need for MicroSD card+MIUI 9 is super lighting fast. + Speaker Output is good but a little bit noisy. I like the sound quality in MI A1Cons:- No fast charging Support. Hope Xiaomi enable this in next update- No USB Type- No SD card Slot- Face unlock set up is easy but accuracy is not great. in 5 attempts only 2 times succeed in low light,5.0

The display is beautiful and sharp.Sound:The sound output from speakers is excellent. The speakers are loud and clear.Battery:The battery lasted for 1.5 days with medium to heavy usage. SOT( Screen On Time) was more than 8 hours which is excellent.Camera:The dual back camera is very impressive and can compete with OnePlus 5T. Pictures are sharp and have plenty of details. Portrait mode works really well and pictures look great.The front camera is a 20MP sensor and it takes some great pictures. The beautify effect works well. The front camera also has a portait mode and gives a nice blur effect. Front flash was useful in low light conditions and improved selfie quality.Processor:The Snapdragon 636 chipset is a beast.

579,Good quality product,This is my first MIUI phone. I was a little cautious about buying a Redmi phone. But I was wrong Redni note 5 pro excels in every field of mobile. I feel that it was a good decision overall. Buying mobile from Flipkart was awesome with fast delivery. Now lets talk about The mobile.Display is crisp and vibrant with new 18:9 aspect ratio.Sound quality is loud and goodSnapdragon 636 is blazing fas processors for a mid ranger phoneYou can do heavy gaming on this phone without any lag.Battary 4000 mah will last atleast one day for a heavy user.MIUI experiance is Good and upcoming MIUI 10 will be amazing.4GB Ram and 64 GB internal memory is good enough so you can use dual sim istead of inserting a micro sd card.Both Front and Rear cameras are Good than the compitition in its price range. With dual rear and single front camera Note 5 pro is trualy a modern phone.These are my intial impression of Redmi Note 5 Pro. Please ask if you have any specific question regarding this phone.,4.0

Display is quite good, sharp, vibrant  and 18:9 make it look more elegant. viewing angle are good enough. camera is good, capture nice shorts on day light and in low light as well with flash. portrait mode good but miA1 detect the edges better but again far better than other. front camera can capture nice portrait selfies. front flash is there that improves the low light selfies. big plus point is the 4000mah battery. face unlock feature is there on MiUi update soon after booting the device. I hardly play games so can't tell about gaming performance.Overall it's a mid range, premium looking device till date. Definitely recommend under 15k budget.",5.0

606,Simply awesome,"Let's just say it, the flash sale does suck. I waited for a month in front of the computer to get past that faster than lightening sale method to get hold of the phone. Finally, on 4th April, luck shined bright upon me and Flipkart showed mercy on my resilient soul. Let me assure everyone. Once you cross the hurdle of the flash sale that refused to budge every time I attempted before this occasion, you will not have a single complaint against this phone. The delivery by Flipkart was as smooth as it can go. I have been using this piece of gem for almost a month now. Here are some of its mind-blowing features:Awesome camera, both the rear and the selfie one. The portrait mode in the dual rear camera and the presence of flash in the selfie camera would take your breath away. I have not touched my DSLR since the time this phone came into my life.The interface is flawless and extremely user-friendly. Before making up my mind to purchase this phone, I came across a couple of reviews where it has been mentioned that compared to the Android One in Mi A1(which is a very close contender to this phone), Redmi Note 5 Pro lacks in performance. But to be honest, I have not faced any such issue so far. Rather, I am quite mesmerized by its steadfastness.Design and build-wise, this is probably the most aesthetically pleasing phone in this budget range. I had a quandary before opting for such a large screen phone (5.99).Surprisingly enough, because of the bezel less design and the 18:9 aspect ratio, the phone feels really well in your palm. One can, in fact, operate it with one hand as well.Long-lasting battery is another of its plus points. Even after heavy usage, the battery goes on for two days. Although the charger is not a turbo one, but it does a pretty decent job in fast recharge.However, there was some issue with the screen display initially. I have read about the existence of some bug. But after one system update, the display looks as amazing as the rest of the phone.In a nutshell, in 14 thousand rupees, this is the best phone the market can offer at this stage. Flash sale is still a big headache. But once you are past it, the journey of android that Redmi Note 5 Pro embarks you into, is simply awe-inspiring.",5.0

634,Super!,"First of all kudos to Flipkart for a fast delivery ..Not a fan of flash sales though. Had to try for the past 6 sales to finally get it.Coming to the device itself, let me start by saying the pros of this device.1. Wickedly fast for a budget phone. Anything that I throw at it runs smoothly2. Amazing battery. Can easily get you through the day even with heavy usage. Moderate usage can get u about 1.5-2 days3. Good rear camera pics during daylight and artificial light conditions. Low light photos are a mix bag. I would rate it average for a low light shoot. During extreme low light situations don't even bother unless you use a flash. Front camera does a very good job. Portrait mode requires multiple clicks to get an ideal image4. Decent speaker quality and loudness5. Amazing screen quality6. Good call quality and receptionComing to the cons1. Mediocre  camera at low light2. Still uses micro-usb. Not a big deal though.3. Shockingly bad headphone quality. I hope they fix it with an update( Unless you are an audiophile like me you won't really mind )This is easily the best phone under 15k. I am still giving it a 5 star due to that reason. Go ahead and buy it without any hesitation. Only one request to Xiaomi pls don't make me go through the flash sales in the future",5.0

Also, the beautification feature surprisingly looks realistic rather than making one look like an anime character. The otherwise perfect front camera just falls short of capturing detailed low-light images. But overall, the Note 5 Pro does stand up to the camera beast tag it comes with.While smartphone brands had a tough time dealing with the Note 4‚Äôs success through 2017, there‚Äôs now a new headache for everyone else to deal with in the Rs 15k price segment.If you love your Redmi Note 4, the Note 5 Pro is totally worth it.

703,Go For It!!,"Hello Everyone,I booked this phone at it's first sale on FK, and writing the review after using it little over a month. Let's cut it short and get straight to point.PROS:1. Front camera: Super awesome. Girls, you won't need any beauty app. Image stabilization works perfectly fine.2. RAM: 4 GB variant is more than enough for moderate to heavy usage. No lags.3. Superb display: 18:9 display in this price range..Wow!!4. Great call quality. No call drops at all5. No lags/frames drop while playing Asphalt 8, Fifa 2018 etc.CONS:1. Rear camera could have been better. Performance below par in low lighting conditions.2. Supported till Android Oreo only(I haven't received the update yet).3. Very slippery. You've got to have a back cover for this phone(Provided along with the handset).Battery lasts 1.5 days under heavy usage(Games/Mobile Data/Continuous FB, Whats app usage).Suggestion: Don't go for 6 GB variant. Waste of money. 4 GB is far more than enough for moderate to heavy user.Cheers,Kishan",5.0

Face unlock, fingerprint, gyroscope, double tap to wake, etc...etc. powered by snapdragon 636 processor, 4000mah Lithium polymer battery, 4/6GB RAM made it a perfect budget friendly device.

In its Range its the best you can go for.But  I would recommend to go for POCO F1 Or Honor 8 pro at 20k.If your phone lags or screen freezes try updating the system.,4.0
739,Classy product,"Awesome device. Bought this in the initial sales when it was priced for 14000. In its first month, the phone showed problem in charging i.e. it would stop charging on its own sometimes even while being connected to power supply. I thought that I had got a faulty product but after the next software update, everything was back to normal. Never faced the same issue till this day. Even the power button seemed to had issues like sometime recognising 2 clicks in a single click but that to got solved with same software update. Probably that software batch was faulty. Other than these issues everything had always been perfect.The camera is awesome till you zoom the image and pixle peep on which you will discover the inglorious plasticky nature of redmi lineup which creeps from the software processing. Don't get me wrong. The camera takes some amazing photos which will make you wonder about the price efficiency but if you are looking to get images that remains same even after zooming in, this isn't the phone. The manual mode is a joke with no control of shutter speed or focus. I always used to take 3 photos- 1st in auto mode 2nd in HDR and last in 100 ISO in so called manual mode. I found that in 90% of the cases, the auto mode photo, if not best, was on par with the other ones. HDR does makes a difference sometimes but the dedicated night mode is worthless. Now you might be wondering that why had I rated 5 stars even after all these problems. Let me clarify that these kind of problems are bound to trouble you even if you take the costliest flagship but what matters is the end user experience of long turn which has been great. There have been some downs but all those lasted for a few days at max and got resolved in next software update.The processor on this one is awesome. I have played PUBG a lot, literally, and the phone doesn't break a sweat. Neither it gets unbearable hot nor does the battery take any major hit and you would definitely enjoy playing all sorts of games thoroughly.I was using Asus ZenFone 2 ZE550ML which had 3000mAh battery before this one. It had an intel processor which used to drink the battery like insanely. I used to get max 3.5 hours of screen on time on that so while shifting to this phone, I have never regretted my decision. This 4000 mAh battery is the real boon for me. I have even got some insane like 12+ hours screen on time on this one!!!It can easily last you for 2 days if you are a moderate user and it doesn't even take much long to get charged. You can get a full day's worth of battery in like 45 mins.Another amazingly awesome thing about this one is that it has one of the finest network reception ability. I have used this phone for my month long travel with 4 of my friends and there were many instances when none of my friends phone had any signal and my note 5 pro not only had great signal strength but also gave me good internet speeds. All were using JIO as primary sim.Overall its a value for money device and you can take this deal with eyes closed!!!Hats off Xiaomi....",5.0

I wonder how such a conpany is even allowed to sell its way through with such major concerns.

865,Pretty good,"1) DesignNice design and good build quality, as has been the case with the entire Redmi Note series. The design is simple and works, but is largely a continuation of the old Redmi Note design - it's not a gorgeous, stand out device by any means.2) DisplayNice looking, modern 5.99 inch 18:9 display, with minimal bezels and has good viewing angles, brightness levels, and colour reproduction looks pleasing in day-to-day useIn spite of the large screen, the phone remains quite ergonomic because of the tall, minimal-bezel form factor.3) SoftwareMIUI interface over Android is snappy, and offers some added features such as dual apps and second space with dual apps, one can run separate accounts of the same service/app and the second space functionality provides separate user experiences for example for work and home while MIUI is one of the nicer Android UI's, it does have some bloat in terms of unneeded apps and a lot of people still prefer a more stock Android approach.4) PerformanceStellar performance, the single most defining aspect for the Note 5 Pro may be the excellent new chip that powers it the Snapdragon 636 in short in terms of both benchmarks and real life use it blows every other phone in the price bracket out of the water be it the loading times for heavy games, opening multiple apps or just switching between multiple heavy apps and games  the phone simply sails through everythingThe heat management is excellent too the phone hardly gets warm even after playing games on the phone for an hour straight5) CameraVery good set of dual cameras at the rear - you have a 12MP primary camera (Sony IMX486) with a sensor size of 1.25um and an aperture of f/2.2 - the secondary 5MP camera is used for depth sensing only and has a sensor size of 1.12um with f/2.0 aperture - in ample lighting conditions, the camera captures a good amount of details and has a punchy colour reproduction - low light image capabilities are equally good and the camera has good dynamic range - even the portrait (bokeh) images look better than most of its competitors - they carry plenty of details and the background blur is also quite good.On the whole, Redmi Note 5 Pro offers everything you need from this price bracket - superior performance, excellent battery life and a good camera - simply put, this is almost a complete package when it comes to mid-range smartphone but still continues with the old micro USB standard, there is no modern USB Type-C support.",4.0

1061,Good quality product,Delivery by flipkart was fast.. and i am happy with this smartphone..although i think dual camera doesn't improve picture quality compare to redmi note 5... so just one suggestion if you get redmi note 5 cheaper than this redmi note 5 pro then go with it.. because i don't found any difference between them (i own both redmi note 5 & redmi note 5 pro) .. and as always flipkart is the only e-commerce site i trust because i never ever got cheated or got rong products.. they always give genuine products which is great.i also bought iphone 6s plus from flipkart 2 year ago.. and that smartphone is still working great! have a nice day people!,4.0

1110,Worth the money,"The phone is nice & working really good, though performance level shooted to quite a refined extent after using a memory card.The only drawback I noticed is that of return policy... just to check the return policy of Flipkart in regard to this product I raised a return/replacement request (the request was made by me just to check if someone face any issue being provided in return/replacement policy section, then in what way will they respond... though i ain't had any intention to return my phone), & to my utter shock they not only completely rejected the request but further added that there are so many returns from my side... whereas from the day I opened my Flipkart account not a single return has been made from my side ( though the seller himself cancelled one of my order just a day before the delivery date for his own known reasons which were never ever explained to me niether by the seller nor by Flipkart!!!!!)... this is the sheer disappointment I faced from Flipkart... don't know if after this Flipkart will block my account as usual or not!!!!!

1114,Really Nice,First coming to the bodythe body is quite stunning and looks good from the outside probably the best looking phone in this price rangethe phone cover which you recieved inside the box does not provide any protection so I recommend that you buy a good phone cover too .Now coming to the camera.the camera performance is quite good in this budget phone the front camera is 20 px with portrait mode.if you are a selfie geek this is a good phone with buty mode variability..and back dual camera is a beast with a good resolution photos which does not pixelate after being zoomed in..AND ALL THE THINGS YOU PROBABLY KNOW BAOUT THIS PHONE THROUGH YOUTUBE CHANNELS..BUT .but you should ho for the Asus m1 pro it has the same specs as this phone just the front camera has a little low pixels ..but the GPU is 5 times better than rn5 pro in this phone the PUBG only runs till balanced but in Asus it runs in HD and looks better than rn5 pro..and it's cheaper than rn5 pro that's why you should go for..ASUS M1 PRO.,4.0

It's just that Redmi phones don't have that elegant element in their look as oppo and vivo have, but looking at price it is a great deal.

Asus ZenFone 4 selfie gets 2 bars of network, whereas this mob has 0 network. even if network is shown call clarity is bad. if you staying in area where you already got network issue, you should not go for this. reviewing it after purchasing handset for self. and also based on another person who had purchased same handset. if redmi has some update fix for this, they should make it available very soon. what is the use of mobile if reception is bad. Motorola one power is lot better. I missed it launched after 2 months purchase of this mob purchase.",1.0

1513,Simply awesome,"BEST BUDGET SMARTPHONE!!This smartphone is heart throbbing. It's a complete package. I ordered this in july and it's been 2 months, I have been using it and haven't faced any issues like heating problems and lagging, completely smooth performance and it performs really fantastic in all the departments whether it is camera for photography purposes or speaker for music or ram management for gaming and apps, it has just impressed me with its ultimate performance and it has each and every aspect which outshines its competitors totally. It supports fast charging, has 4000mah battery, gorilla glass for protection, snapdragon636 processor and 12+5 megapixel primary camera with 20 megapixel front camera, after software updates portrait shots are just brillant and camera also takes superb images in low light mode.Simply unbeatable and if you have to buy a smartphone which should be a complete package and this should be the only choice as most other brands in the market skip a few important features or sensors to reduce the cost of the product and that would be quite unsatisfactory in regular use(like honor skips gyroscope or gorilla glass protection in most of their smartphones).

Cons :Only one, video quality drops drastically in low lighting conditions, not only low but even indoors.. video quality is very average.Verdict :This phone is a clear winner for this price range but Xiaomi has just released MI A2 which is stock andriod and has a 12+20 at the back compared to 12+5 of RN 5 pro and a faster processor (Snapdragon 660) for 2k more *but* it comes with a 3000 mah battery and without a 3.5mm audio jack. RN 5 pro could still just edge A2 out by a small margin since battery life and audio jack are essential parts of a phone.",5.0

ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS PHONE IT'S HUGE DISPLAY PHONE USE IT WITH VERY CAREFULLY IF IT FALLS ONLY FROM 3M DISPLAY WILL BE BROKE OR OCCUR CAMERA PROBLEM. SO USE VERY GOOD QUALITY GLASS PROTECTOR AND ALSO PROTECT THE PHONE WITH 360¬∞ FALLING COVER.IN 15K FROM MY POINT OF VIEW IT'S BEAST AND BEST.

1681,Nice,"I ordered this on 12th Aug and Got it on 17th. They took 4 days to ship the mobile. It is not expected from flipkart, This was the first time when the Product was not packed well... Any accidental fall would have broken my display. I reduced two stars because of Delivery and Restriction by Xiaomi to Uninstall unwanted apps... I'm a Stock Android lover but I used MIUI for the first time and trust me the features are awesome and I love MIUI.PROS-Fast-Cameras are not best but good in this price segment.-2 updates (150mb then 1.4 gb immediately when you turn on the phone)-Portrait mode in front camera only after oreo update.-Amazing remote control app.-Split Screen, Gestures, One Hand, Plethora of features from MIUI.-Awesome Battery Backup.CONS-Too much uninstallable bloatware.-Camera takes little unrealistic pictures.-After Using for few days I realise MIUI have so many bugs. After 9.6 update, Camera app have got so much of Lag, Although fingerprint scanner and Face Unlock have started working so much faster.",3.0

1686,Not recommended at all,Flipkart is cheating us by doing marketing for Chinese companies. Not sure how the rating  for this phone is more than 4.

1689,Excellent,"I had used this device as my primary device for a week and it is a beast with beauty in it.. on all aspects this phone is worth for every penny!! Lets come to this phone it's a premium looking device with a huge battery!!And it's matte finish looks good. I had played heavy games like pubg, asphalt 9 and it's handing like a piece of cake.. the ram management is superb with the beast processor.. while coming to mid range phone this one is the flagship phone. The black one looks better than any other colors. And the best part is the camera it's really amazing. And at normal lighting's it performs very well but in low light it gets Disturbed and the esi in video session performs like anything and the audio quality is very loud you can conduct a house party also!!. And the huge 4000mah battery lasts up to 2 days in normal usage and 1-1.5 days easily.. the one and only cons is the notification light which cannot be changed and it is also White color so if you go for gold or blue color it is difficult to indicate it to come over it go for black color... And I'm hardly finding cons but there is no other cons as well.. Blindly go for the redmi note 5 pro and you will feel the beast in the hand..",5.0

If you are in need of a good camera mobile,then go for it. other wise you can choose any budget phone under 10k. Sound with earphones 8/10. Touch 8/10. I just wanted to highlight above 2 features. Rest of all features are ok like any other smart phone. Previously I am using Coolpad note 3 which have invincible touch and it produces great sound with earphones.Bottom line : As everyone says buy Redmi note 5 pro only when you are in need of Best camera.

If you are a moderate user then it will be the best phone for you.some pros of this phone are1. Amazing dual camera for some good looking portrait pics.2. Having EIS ( electronic image stabilization ) for recording smooth stable video.3. Shard full HD 16:9 aspect ratio display 4. Mid range beast Snaodragon 636 processsor, Can handle your day to day activities very smoothly. Not all phone perfect even iPhone X So Here are some cons which I found1. Due to heavy processor and large display, the battery last long upto a 12 hours day( Not night)2. And hell yeah sometimes the phone lags. That's all major points about this phone, But i still love this phone.",5.0
1898,Absolute rubbish!,I brought a new product which was not working and I complained on 18th July for replacement. 12 days have passed since then and Flipkart has shown no interest in getting it returned is this how customer satisfaction is measured. Sadly now I have to say that I WAS a pro Flipkart customer but this kind of lethargic behaviour is unacceptable and inappreciable. And now I am going to post the same in social media.,5.0

2124,Mind-blowing purchase,after trying at a number of flash sales I finally got my hands on this phone. To be fair it's a little bigger in size compared to other phones but it's slim and decently handy. The display is pretty good and all the apps I use run smoothly on the phone. The battery life is decent. on a single charge it lasts for a day. But with heavy net use have to charge it twice daily. my previous Lenovo phone had the same amp battery but lasted literally for 2 days.The biggest wow factor of this phone is the camera. the dual rear camera packs a punch and gives some pretty awesome daytime pics. Night time photography without flash is not that great. The front camera is pretty good too but it lightens all images despite turning off auto enhancement. another great thing is the image stabilization feature on video. that's simply mind-blowing.over all this phone is a must buy and packs too much tech under it without burning a hole in your pocket.check the attached images from my trip displaying the camera performance.,5.0

2194,The best 15K phone in the market,"I write my review based on the last 2 weeks i have had this phone with me.Pros-1. the 4000 mAh battery is worth the buy. I can spend the entire day with about 2 hours of charging, even when wifi along with wifi/data is active.2. The connectivity is pretty good, i had a HTC One E9+ before this and running JIO 4g data on it meant that i would have till about 2 mBps downloading speed and for the same place,time and download source the download speed is as much as 5 mBps.3.There is next to nothing in terms of heat generated. I can run 4g streaming and wifi for hours on end and it wouldn't heat up.4. The phone is pretty fast in terms of performance, doesn't hang even if you keep shuffling between apps.5. The rear camera performs as good as you can expect from a 15k phone but, the front camera is pure beauty. The image quality of the front camera is made so that you never miss out on those perfect selfies with your friends and family.6. The display is a 1080p display with a 18:9 display ratio which delivers a sharp and crisp display quality.Cons-None so far.",5.0

2349,Great product,"Most of the comments already covered most of things about the phone. I tried to put forward my personal experience.(Note : Been used this phone almost 3 months)1. Flash sale sucks. Still you can use 3rd party add-ons to make yourself a room in flash sales. I used flipshope chrome extension which worked fine.2. Camera does average performance in poor lighting conditions. In good lighting portrait mode works better. front camera is comparatively good and it can click nice selfies. however, beauty mode over saturate and over polish the images which makes them look artificial. 3. Performance is very fluid. I din face any major lags even in multiplayer LAN games. Whenever I clear all applications in task bar, it clears only 2GB of RAM out of 4GB. I dunno how remaining memory is managed. Anyways, It din cause any performance issue till day.3. Display looks bit dull in outdoor visibility and colors look like washed out a bit. Again it is a personal preference and some may be fine with it. Outdoor visibility is good when I enable auto brightness. Viewing angles also fine and din face any color shifting issues.4. Build is solid and feel compact in hand. I dropped few times and it din cause me any scratch in display. Design doesn't feel unique as it does remind me of iphone's vertical camera setup. Again it is personal preference. 5. Sound quality is very good. When increase volume to maximum level, feels bit obscure. Otherwise works perfectly fine in all conditions.6. Battery is where this mobile stands out. I can easily get nearly 8 hours of screen on time which means, Continuous usage of 8 hours which in case is the best in class. Din feel any heat issue which is not Xiaomi's thing. It takes around 2 hours to charge 100%. I usually charge 40-50% in morning and able to get full day moderate usage. Turbo charger doesn't make big difference in charging time which you have to buy externally.After all, It doesn't put a hole in my budget and still put smile on my face for what I paid..!",5.0

2413,Good quality product,"Processor: Is very capable. Haven't seen any lag or stuttur on day to day usage and even on gaming.Heating: This phone can run almost all the graphic intensive games without issues. The back might get WARM after sometime. Remember it doesn't get hot, just WARM.Camera: No complaint regarding camera department. Picture quality is good. Bokeh effect works quite well. Video recording is also fine. Best part is it has EIS(Electronic Image Stabilization). So what whrn you take video, it wouldn't be shaky. RAM: This is where the phone dissapoints a bit. Out of the box you only get 1.7 gb free RAM out of 4 gb. Because this phone runs on a custom UI (MIUI). Hence less available RAM. Stock Android phones consume less RAM. My Lenovo K8 Note has stock Android, and even when I have several apps running, I still get 50% RAM left. In short MIUI is RAM hungry. Screen Quality: Excellent.Overall: 4/5. Hope this review helps.Audio Output: Great. Build Quality: Is actually good. Not that great. Doesn't feel that much solid. Redmi Note 5 still feels solid. But Redmi note 5 pro doesn't feel that solid. But it's not bad either.Call Quality: Excellent.",4.0

2452,Does the job,affordable smart phone. camera doesn't give good results in low light conditions. digital zoom is useless. Company is not providing C Type USB port with this model.

2828,Just wow!,"It's been two months now and this phone has performed excellent in every way, be it multi tasking or speed, camera performance or battery life, gaming or social networking, this scores exceptional. I've never faced any issues till today.Genius is the word I'd say to describe it's UI if I had to say in one word. Everything from It's Desktop to the tiniest element like Contact detailing or WiFi connection menu, you'd find a Genius's mindfulness! Man, the stock android is as far as the 7 seas from this to sail to MiUi even with the Android Oreo, Android P or whichever to come next. I mean to say is that the difference is much BIGGER. All in all, It's a Gem amongst all other brand's Customised Android OS and with no doubt, the best.Talking about battery life, it would last about almost two days anyhow if you don't play heavy games too much and just in case you do, it's hard for you to drain it completely in working a day.Talking about camera, the selfie camera performance outsmarts many high end phones. Selfie flash does the job in low light pretty good. The rear camera performance is also exceptional for the price. Portrait mode gives much more appealing results in daylight, but in low light there's no flash option in it which leads to under standard image outputs. Though there's HDR mode which improves the images taken in Portrait mode in low light conditions but again it demands fair amount of stability of hands. Other than that, in normal mode low light photography tick all necessary checks.The display is excellent and easily readable in direct sunlight. The color reproduction is accurate and user gets a pleasant experience overall.Heavy games and high end apps runs smooth and with no heating issues.Call quality and other network connectivity is excellent.One thing that got my attention is that the speaker output, though this has a single speaker, it is clear and loud. The sound quality is so good that I loved listen to from the very first time.Summarising everything, I'd say, as it's name suggests, RN5Pro is a PRO in every area for the price it's offered even with the hike of 1000/- in it's price. It still stands first amongst it's current competitors like Honor,. Asus etc.",5.0

2875,Value-for-money,"I will only mention the cons that I felt are there.But before that, I love the one handed mode. Although I have pretty big palm, sometimes the phone feels too big to operate. One hand mode is the solution. Thanks Xiaomi for that.  The phone lags when playing games like asphalt on high specs. The front flash is really of no use as such. The low light pics are still grainy but I think it can be improved by twitching the software a bit(so let's wait and see).Same goes for rear camera. The battery isn't as expected. Although it lasts a day on medium to heavy usage but standby time isn't good enough. Charging time is too much with the in-box charger(2 and a half hours approx) When i use a Samsung S5 charger it goes from 0-100 in two hours approx. So buy a turbo charger and you're good to go. Phone feels a bit heavy at times but again understandably so. I will keep the list updated.edit 1- Although the viewing angles are good, the sunlight legibility is below par. You expect more from Xiaomi. ps: No phone is perfect and this phone certainly is value for money for it's beastly performance, great camera quality, awesome battery life. Really a mid range king.Overall-  9/10",4.0

But as I said it left me wanting more for following features, I have used it for 10 days,1. 4K video recording.2. USB Type C port.3. Bundled Quick charger with phone.4. Oreo update.5. Dedicated Memory card slot.6. I would have preferred 6GB variant at 16999/- only if it had provided 6GB+128GB config.7.

I was very disappointed.. Then I came to knew there is portrait mode even for Selfies and suddenly it made my day.. It's just mind blowing.. üòçlove the selfie camera.. Coming to the apps, I found snapchat, and few apps were stopping unexpectedly and I sent my crash report.. With in 2 days got an update of 35 mb from Miui. And all problems solved. They are working flawless. I felt great they responded so fast. Battery is very gud.. It's triple time compared to my redmi note 3 which I'm using. Sound is bit loud so I kept in 80 always. but it's useful for elder people  who respond for louder volumes.. Screen is big but I didn't like the menu bar in the down which occupying the bottom and makes screen size 5inch but then I found that I can hide the menu bar, notification bar for 18:9 full display (through YouTube videos) . U can also customize for certain apps to hide or enable. So i loved it and enjoying big screen Specially when I watch ipl or movies. There is no 4k recording but 'full hd' is enough. Mi Screen recording app is very gud but  There is only 2 options mute/mic. I wonder why? As note 3 has 3 options mute/mic/system sound.. So waiting for the update. So i suggest every one to watch the hidden tips and tricks of note 5 pro on YouTube and u will enjoy this mobile even  more. There is option to split screen to enjoy 2 apps at a time and many more to do. Thanks to xiaomi for ths superb mobile in reasonable price. üòòüòòüòò",5.0

U get almost every necessary apps preinstalled  & after 2nd boot u will get  around 2.2Gb of ram free.Though one problem i face is that filpkart told that delivery will be within 2 days , but take extra 3 days. Though the phone reached very much nearest hub  from my  home within 2 days ,bt they deliverd it very lately  . Thats why I am dissapointed with Filpkart  Ekart service .

But Redmi Note 5 Pro does not have that much. In rear camera, Bokeh effect (Portrait mode or depth mode) is not so good, it also blurs the sides of the object (remember, Bokeh effect in MI A1 is also not perfect but seems slightly better than Redmi Note 5 Pro).

3185,Simply awesome,nice phone,5.0
3186,Mind-blowing purchase,"Bang for a buck for 14klet's talk about detailed experience with the phone in the past 2 weeksscreen- Screen quality is good. good Color production , pixel density is also good. while watching YouTube videos many people complaint that the video crops on the left and right side, but you can pinch zoom in the video to adjust it according to your need. I give it 9/10 due to lack of amoled displayProcessor- The Snapdragon 636 is a beast when it comes to price. the Antutu benchmark of this phone comes out about 1,15,000. but the GPU used is same as used in Snapdragon 625, but it's not any great issue. I give it 10/10 for processorBattery- The lithium ion 4000 mAh battery last up to 2 days for an average user. with a full battery drain my display usage was about 9 hours. only one thing I complaint is the lack of fast charging, though the SD 636 supports Qualcomm quickcharge 4.0. but you can use a charger 9 volts 2 amps to fast charge it. it takes about 3.5 hours to fully charge it. I give it 10/10Camera- I am a bit disappointed with the camera. the rear camera struggles while capturing images in low light due to poor aperture but that's ok. what else can you get in a 14k smartphone. while using portrait mode, it captures images of only 5 mpix.though in good light camera performance is awesome. natural Colors, fast autofocus, and a bit overexposed. now come to the front camera.I don't think it's a 20 mpix camera. it behaves like a 8 mpix camera. without beauty mode it adds beauty to your face. the AI is awesome. the portrait mode is very good in both the cameras. and no automatic flash in the stock camera app. the flash keeps on during clicking photos in the nightAlso lack of 4k recording but Xiaomi promised to fix it in the next update. the electronic image stabilization is awesome. I give it 8/10 stars for camera.Operating system- MIUI is quite smooth and fast. with many additional features like app lock and dual apps. so 8/10 stars for OS because I don't like MIUI's interfaceRAM- the blazing fast LPDDR4X is amazing. apps load very fast. and thanks to 4GB of ram you can keep a lot of apps in the background. and it is also very energy efficient. so 10/10 for RAMMiscellaneous- there are other lots of great features like.fingerprint sensor is fast but not too accurate. face unlock is great even in low light. sound quality is good from speakers and as well as headphones but I expected a dual speakers. lack of usb type c connector and it comes with a hybrid sim and sdcard tray.Though these features comes in a price tag of 13,999 from xiaomi, this is a fully allrounder phone. but as Xiaomi says ""India's camera beast"", I don't agree with Xiaomi.but it's a bang for a buck.

3318,Just wow!,one of the best phone in this price segment .... the most wanted phone of the year .. the camera is outstanding ... it can even take slow motion videos which is a plus . the flash sale is a little bugging but try (ADD TO CART ) option instead of (BUY NOW) .. It does work guys try it. The 18:9 aspect ratio is great but some apps don't support it ... which is a con ... the display is great .. it doesn't have NFC there is a micro USB instead of type c which is alo a con ... otherwise the phone is awesome and outstanding ... go for it if your budget is between 14000 to 15000 .. the 6 gb is not that necessary ..  the 4 gb variant with gold is great ...,5.0

3328,Very Good,"I really don't think a review is needed for this product as a lot of reviews are already across all forums.The phone is simply awesome. I am a simple user with primary usage being camera, few social media apps, emails & calls and the phone performs very well. For looks I can give this phone 6 stars but I am giving only 4 stars overall simply because of the weekly sales. This concept of sale is horrible.As a company you want to sell your product and you have a good market because you have a good product to offer. Then what's holding you back? Produce enough units and go bang in the market. I wanted this product and was not able to get it through the weekly sales so I thought I should check out the local markets. I was surprised that people are selling this phone at a premium of 3k-4k per device. More than Xiaomi I guess these sellers were making money because of this sale.",4.0

3336,Perfect product!,"I luckily got note 5 pro from 4th april flash sale from mobile app and got next day delivered.I loved the phone and overall performance is very good , no lag while running the apps. For Clash Royale lovers this phone is currently not supporting full screen and navigation bar is still present while playing game but this is more game issue and not phone problem. Also my phone got freezed once after miui latest update and I restarted my phone and never faced issue till now. Battery backup is good but if u run high end games on 4G internet then battery wont long last much. I recommend using wifi more wherever possible. I have put default back cover which i got in box and it is really good and give good grip in hand. I recommend to put it always on because phone is slippery and it may get damage if dropped without any protection. I will recommend to not buy extra case as the default cover protect camera bump as well, but if u can always go for another case as your wish. Phone does not comes with any earphone and a basic charger which was bit let down for me. Phone supports fast charging and i am charging phone with my asus turbo charger without any issues. Speaker volume is loud and clear. I am not a big selfie fan but camera quality is good for me.Overall : phone is beast and go for it. Grab one from flash sales or wait for few days it will available without flash sale. Gud luck.",5.0

3402,Simply awesome,Used for a week and noticed no hang no lags with games or any other applications. The black color is awesome and looks so premium. Both rear and front cameras are superb with natural looking image. Background blurring effect perfectly works like in a pro DSLR camera and also the front selfie camera does a very brilliant job which applies the bokeh effect via software. The battery back up is extremely good which lasts for the whole 24 hours in a day even after heavy uses. I've not found any cons of the phone regarding to its price under 14k. I'm recommending this phone to all who are thinking of buying a best phone under 14k. This phone is simply the best budget one in India correctly. This time Xiaomi have done a great job by improving their cameras in the budget phones too.,5.0

Also the dual camera do their job well for clicking portrait shots. The front camera quality is amazing in this range.Also it gives depth effect to the pictures clicked.The new sd636 does its job far better than the expectations.Also the adreno 509 does a good job and will will help you enjoy high graphic games.The 18:9 display is pleasure to the eyes.It gives an amazing elegant look to the smartphone.My opinion would be if you want to buy a smartphone in the price range up to 15k then you should surely go for this budget king.,5.0
3418,Mind-blowing purchase,Awesome phone,5.0
3419,Best in the market!,According to me this phone is a real beast in battery and in camera section. But during heavy gaming like if we run Asphalt 8 for half an hour then we see some small lags but it would be unnoticeable. The game which goes without any lags Is Modern Combat 4 and in this phone PUBG lags pretty little which is noticeable so by the way these things to be neglected because out of this all extensive game can play on this device smoothly the word I use smoothly because no one phone can handle too good extensive game like on this note 5 pro neither #Honor 9 lite and one thing also I said this Xiaomi device is in it not have SD 835 or SD 845 which you think that all things gonna gone very fast but this processor perform overall very good but it has a SD 636 which is too good to handle all the works very efficiently so just go with device because in this price no phone company can give you a feature like Xiaomi.,5.0

Rear camera is also good but can be improved but overall is excellent. Battery life is just awful as it can remain for 2 days with normal usage.No lagging especially in heavy games. Built quality is also good. But u have to lift the phone to ur face level for face unlock. Everything is excellent. Speaker is loud.Front flash makes the pic awesome.Pros (Honestly):-BatteryRear CameraFront Camera (awesome)ProcessorNo laggingPerfect DimensionsAlmost EverythingCons (Honestly):-Not at allThe phone gets a little warm during charging but very little warm which is not an issue. Normal Charger takes almost around 2 hours 10 minutes. No need of fast charger.Battery drains about 3-5% after an heavy game and usage after 45 Minutes. I am in love with the graphics of display which is honestly made for gaming.Ratings:-Battery:-10/10Front Camera:-10/10 (Beats iPhone 7 plus)Rear Camera:-9/10Grip:-10/10Processor:-10/10Display:-10/10 (Especially made for gaming)Face Unlock:-8/10Price Segment:-10/10Type-C charger and Hybrid sim slot is not an issue by my side otherwise it depends on the usage of the person.This phone is for :-Heavy UsersGamersSelfie Takers Delivery in just 21 hours.Awesome PhoneThanks Flipkart for fast Delivery.Thanks Xiaomi for this model.,5.0

3548,Brilliant,Great mobile,5.0
3549,Good choice,This is the best phone you can get for under 15000rs. The phone has only a few cons which dampens my review. The low light photos still have the problem of noise and grains. The second biggest problem is that there is no fast charging which puts the user on an akward position to place the phone for overnight charging which damages battery. Other than that the phone is really good. The included case is just barely enough to keep the phone clean and I suggest to buy a good case and tempered glass along with the phone,4.0
3550,Terrific purchase,"Awesome product..however same processors and features you find in other phones but it costs around 17-30k but with less budget you get note 5 pro.* No heating issues* Selfie camera is good with low lighting condition (20 mp)* Back camera comes with dual 12+5 mp (portrait mode)* Battery performance is really awesome (4000 MAh)* Snapdragon 636* 4 GB RAM* 64 GB ROM* Soft touch screen* Large Screen* Runs with MIUI where it customise your phone with     various themes* No lagsOver all phone is great, one should have it if  clever enough, comparing with other phones. however if u want to show-off this is the phone, feels rich in hand rather than having expensive phone.   thank u!",5.0
3551,Great smartphone under 15k,"Battery, display, image quality, performance are great for a phone in this price range. Potrait images are really good, giving great details in depth. Only demerit I see are - no fast charging slot, though a 4000 mAH is sufficient to last one day when fully charged. Rear camera is physically protruding from the body, which feels a bit out of place",4.0

4289,Not recommended at all,"This one is comparatively good. But consider the aged peoples its little not. Many of them told pros con's. I just apart from they forgot.Con's1. The top status bar too little. So the tower, signal strength and battery power, notification icons not legible . they looks tiny. Without specs its difficult to read.2. We could not zoom in out on some places. Example to read message we can't on that page. We set font size at settings only. But some other smart phones gives zoom in out on messages when ever we needed.3. Scanner app is not good. Google play store scanner app gives best result. Example in this redmi n5 pro we need to click the image to scan. But some other scanner takes picture automatically when it focused correctly. Also they save PDF etc. In this is not.4. Toggles notification color is dull. That is also difficult to read or identify. But we can change through theme settings.5. Notification details about gmail is two way. One is separate mail notification. Second one gives simply number of mails. This one is easy wipe out all mail notification. In some other mobiles it shows every new mail notified as separate single line with sender name bold followed by message. So that we can easily checkout the out the mail.6. No more common centre apps button like other smart phones. So its difficult to start any app. We need to memorise where we stored the app. But other mobile we can identify by alphabetical search.Kindly mi consider my opinion. Try update. Otherwise upcoming models no con's.Pros:1. We can wipe out notifications on lock screen.2. Everything is date wise listed.3. Amazing super fast.",1.0
4290,Useless product,"The very first thing is we want to buy a phone not camera, which is a secondary concern. Having seen market for the phone increased the price that's a clear business and not love to the feelings of people who are associated with Redmi.

4310,Classy product,"Reviewed in 3 weeksPros1.Camera quality has been improved from predecessors like redmi note3 &42. Battery optimisation is improved due to Snapdragon635 chipset3. Nice grip in hands and a bigger display gives better typing and user interface. Sleek and handy.4. Better strength in 4G receiver, improved call clearity and noise cancelling. Tried over poor network a good call quality was better than other devices.5. Dual camera does works well and can give the best in class pictures on zooming we can see depth of image. amazed to see pixels don't fade out on zooming.6. Best part of Mi phone is it will cover all your daily needs in a go, without installing any 3rd party apps from playstore.cons1. Doesn't has turbocharger otherwise full battery could be done in an hour done with moto charger worked well. mi charger takes more than 2 hour.2. portrait effect is only available for rear camera not for selfie.3. Portrait effect in rear camera is software based which gives normal effect.Overall best budget phone at this price range.That's all I've felt so far, thank you for reading.",5.0

4336,Fabulous!,This is an excellent phone ...The new Snapdragon processor 626 makes a remarkable difference in performance.. having used both xiaomi mi A1 and Redmi note 5 pro for a week or so. The only thing working for the MiA1 is the Google updates and first in line for major os updates ..other than that...in every department Redmi note 5 pro is the clear winner..The camera too is much better than the MiA1 that is if you are not using the Google camera tool that enables Hal and Google camera libs in MiA1 by manual flashing..which is risky. Even the Note 5s UI which is MIUI 9 is a refreshing change from using stock android for a long time...For haters of MIUI...deal with it a bit and then flash custom roms when they come to get stock android experience ...I'm sure a port will be out soon enough! Buy the phone! As usual Flipkart delivery service was excellent..and I got the handset in my hands within 48hrs.,5.0

It suddenly freezed when I was using Google Chrome for browsing, no such content which would effect the RAM, I was just reading 2-3 articles when suddenly the screen freezed. After I pressed the lock screen button for 5-6 seconds, the phone switched off and restarted, but only to be stuck at a light white screen, even the MI logo isn't being displayed. The phone is heating up a little, hope it doesn't blast in face. I tried following the steps recommended by MI customer care, but still no progress.

(4gb ram variant).3. display is ok but looks like not able to produce vibrant colour pictures.. colour accuracy is not perfect but still good.. display refresh rate is not enough..fast action scenes are going to blurry.4. battery is good, give me enough backup but not good as like asus Zenfone max pro m1..asus is really good in battery backup and in terms of performance.5. fast fingerprint sensor. 95% accurate.6. IR blaster...in many situations is good but not that much good as like actual real IR remote. cons.-1. design wise looks boring..same design again and again.2. camera is good but some time lack of clarity.3. sound quality through speaker is not upto mark. no dpeth effect in sound. volume level just ok but when set it high than speaker loss clearity of sound. from headphone jack output of sound is not that much good, i am not happy.4. big cons is miui its very heavy and hanging phone most time. too many options which is clearly unnecessary.5. network connectivity is low ( in low reception area is directly leave network )6. at same time only one sim can able to take 4G network. 7. camera bump is not good .. chances to damage camera glass.8. in heavy games phone lagging and heating too much. for gaming note 5 pro is not good phone..(if you game and performance lover than go with asus.)9. ram management is low.. not able to hold heavy application in memory.10. hanging problem found when fastly handle phone.11. if ROM is almost full upto 90% than phone start to lagging and hanging.12. hybrid sim slot.. means come-on redmi still you giving hybrid sim slot.. not good.13. some time touch screen not responding. that means phone is stucked and hanged.verdict: over all very good phone at the price of ‚Çπ11300. ( this price is offer period price). if camera and video lover than go with note 5 pro or if you are music , game , performance and battery power house lover than definitely go with asus Zenfone max pro m1 6gb ram model.",4.0

I requested for replacement and was visited by technicians twice who were very adamant that the device is working as expected, and were unwilling to acknowledge that there was any fault in this device, although I had visibly demonstrated the faults that I had noticed. During both visits, they said that the visibly faulty behaviour of the phone was how it was supposed to work (in their words : this is how their system is).

But  I will suggest you go for branded headphones.4. Display is sharp and vivid5- good battery life as it has 4000Mah battery6- Eis function on camera help you to take stable video shooting, which facility you will not get on any 25_30k price range mobile.7- it's protrait mode or in other words bokhey mode is excellent and it beats Vivo V9, Oppo F7, honor 9i lite and other latest model of 15_25k range cell phone.Cons:-1- it will take 2 1/2 months to get the product on flash sale, which is very disappointing to me and others. I would suggest Mi and Flipkart to solve such type of issue. for this reason black market rule over and people get by paying extra 3000 to seller.2- it has not dedicated slot . now a days people are using more than one sim at a time. so provide dedicated slot will hike the sale number of mobile3- one more minus point of Mi is , they are introduced simultaneously more than one model at a time. it will hamper their image and people get confused which one to buy.4- people are not getting updates at a time. when one is running oreo and other is on that nougat version.",5.0

Even though the Asus Zenphone Max Pro tried to beat it on its own ground, Note 5 Pro takes the crown away with its unbeatable camera in the price segment. It goes on winning accolades with its good camera performance till it meets OPPO F7 as the opposition, which is Rs. 7000/- costlier than the RN 5 Pro.

4542,Worst experience ever! Read Might be a long review But worth,"Reviewing after using it for a month.Guys,""THE MOBILE SUCKS, PERIOD"". Might be you have seen many reviews stating that this mobile is awesome and performance is superb no lag nothing like that.But I'll tell you the truth. See the mobile is nice for reviewing for only one day or one day usuage. But if you use it for a long time things are like very weird. Okay I don't beat around the bush I'll give the exact reasons why I'm saying this.By the way I'm kinda user who uses Heavily as well as moderately I did all kinds of experiments till now on this mobileWill start with Pros:1. Good  Battery life 2. Gaming is good 3. Fringer print sensor works fine 4. No HeatingWill Now start the cons:1. Software sucks2. There are like thousands of bugs in the software3. What I've noticed till now is like a lot of times app are getting force closed (app not working )4. Front camera is like for example if you are taking only face by keeping your camera horizontally your belly will be caputured in the mobile.It's like picture is either moving    down or goes up. I don't Now Why this  is happening (after the software update)5. There is a time lag for the shots if you are taking from rear camera6. You cant change the music from volume keys by holding them every time we need to take the mobile out of our pockets to change the next track7. Notification indicator is very small8. If you put any contact picture it either be zoomed in or strecthed but it wont be the image how you cropped and it wont fit the screen exactly.9. Face unlock feature is just like to show off that we do have a face lock like flagship mobiles, its not working properly10. While coming to the volume if you reduce the volume below 50% sound wont come from the device  or very very low sound like 5% volume.11. Ram Management is worst12. Facebook app functionality sucks I don't know it is like if you put that app in memory and try to open it again after using some different application it might be removed from the memory or its reloads again.13. Position of earphone jack is not good because when you sleep and using the mobile with earphones on it you cant keep the mobile on your chest you have to hold the mobile and 360 degree rotation of screen is not there (Normally every one will do at Night) 14. Weather widget on the home screen wont update the weather details automatically we have to update it manually",1.0

4544,Highly recommended,"First thank you flipkart for such fast delivery. I got the product almost within 24 hours from the time I ordered.      Now my honest  review about the product                        1.battery(9/10)- the 4000 mah battery is a powerhouse, it will easily last for one and a half days under medium usage.              2. Display(7.5/10)- Not the best in class display but still not the worst as well you will either love it or hate it.             3.processor(9/10)- have been using the phone for few weeks now no lags or hangs what so ever no matter what you throw in its way it works effortlessly.                                                             4. Camera- (7.5/10)first if anyone who wants to buy note 5 pro solely because of the camera then i would suggest don't go for this one. The rear camera does a pretty good job and it's a huge improvement from last year's note 4. But the 20 mp front cam is not at all upto the mark and it struggles in low light situation. So for all those selfie lover's would suggest you look for other options.",5.0
4545,Good quality product,"I gave 4 star only for flash sale.... please stop it.ADD per IP address for it's order.Otherwise Device is awesome, I'm a fan of Xiomi products....

4637,Nice Product,"Pros:Gorgeous Display - Front Display is better than back coverGreat Camera Quality under daylight conditions - Front camera is betterExcellent Battery Backup - Total time to charge (0% to 100%) is 2 hrs 40 min, and battery backup is 38 hrs with full day usage and WIFI on continuouslyMany hidden features which are awesome , example is second space creation, locking the apps to uninstall, dual apps, etc etcSo many shortcuts with this great phoneSound quality is goodCons:No fast chargingHybrid Sim Slot(1 Sim + 1 Sim or 1 Memory Card)Face unlock is not workingBack panel make is not good for camera, Always a risk of the camera lens may get spoilNo NFCNo Dual VoLTE supportPrice is increased by 1k which is not good from MiNo ear phone included in boxNo Screen guard included in boxRatings:Design: 8/10Display: 9/10Sound: 9/10Battery: 9/10Back Camera: 9/10Front Camera: 10/10Processor: 9/10Call Quality: 9/10Face Unlock : 0/10Sound from Speakers: 9/10Sound from Earphones: 9/10Pricing: 8/10Overall Rating: 8/10Deailed Review: So here's what you get inside the box:1. Handset2. Charger (5V, 2amps)[ A fast charger must be given with this model, but they provide only 2Amp charger but still gives a very fast speed of charging ]3. USB charging cable(very short & seems very low quality(design), but gives a very good speed of charging)4. Sim ejector pin5. A transparent soft case[ Thanks to Xiaomi , almost saved my 300 Rs.(original Mi soft cover) ]Design:It looks very decent. The design of the phone is not great but not bad as well. I like the 2.5D glass on the front which gives it a premium look. The phone is slightly taller than Redmi Note 4 but the width is a bit smaller. It is easier to hold because of the smaller width but due to extra length, it will be difficult to hold it through one hand to go to the top of screen. Overall the design is good and I would give it 7/10.Display:The display is large 5.99 inch with 18:9 aspect ratio and Full HD+ resolution. The display is beautiful and sharp. The viewing angles are good and it is sufficiently bright for read properly under sunlight. Display Rating: 8.5/10Sound:The sound output from speakers is excellent. The speakers are loud and clear. Xiaomi has made great improvement here compared to previous Redmi Note 3 and Note 4.The sound output from 3.5mm headphone jack is good. Tip: Use sound enhancer in settings to improve sound quality.The call quality and clarity was great as well both on earphones but might be some echo with speakers(I hope this will be resolved in next some updates).Battery:The battery lasted for 1.5 days with medium to heavy usage. SOT( Screen On Time) was more than 8 hours which is excellent. 10/10Camera:12MP+5MP Dual Rear Camera Pictures are really great and can comete with Oneplus 5T. Pictures have plenty of details and very sharp. Portrait mode is awesome. 20MP Front Camera with FlashGreat pictures & beautify effect works well. The front camera also has a portait mode and gives a nice blur effect. Front flash was useful in low light conditions and improved selfie quality.Processor:Snapdragon 636 chipset latest and 1st phone with it. Just unreachable in processing and gives a tough compition to others under 15000 price range phone.Face Unlock:Face unlock is awesome. It registered face data very quickly. it is working great. I tried it with 2-3 other people and they were not able to open the phone. It is quick(unlocks in less than a second.) Overall, Redmi Note 5 Pro is an excellent value for money device with good looks, great camera, long battery life, powerful chipset. I don't think we will see a better smartphone under 15000 this year. Go for it if your budget is 15000.",5.0

These phones are definitely far more inferior in hardware to note 5 pro , but gives good user experience.Do like the comment for letting me know about Ur support",2.0

6041,Highly recommended,"Great Budget Oriented Smartphone.I've been using this as my primary phone from the past 15 months & i'll divide my feedback into the pros & cons.PROS.1. Screen Quality is excellent. Not an AMOLED screen but the viewing angles are really good & is also visible under direct sunlight.2. Cellular call quality is good & call reception is good too.3. Fingerprint scanner used to lag a bit initially but after 2 software updates has eversince worked fine.4. RAM management has been done pretty good here. No issues whatsoever faced by me but again i'm not a extremely heavy user.5. It runs on MIUI & out of the box has pre installed apps but you can uninstall them if you want to. The interface doesn't lag but again Oxygen OS in Oneplus is a different ball game.6. It has an IR blaster for you to remotely operate your AC or TV which is a good thing but i never used it.7. It has a hybrid sim slot so 2 sims or 1 sim & 1 Microsd card which is also a great feature.8. It has a 3.5mm headphone jack & i must say the audio output via the headphone jack is quite good. I do use a lot high end headphones as well as budget headphones. It has a single bottom firing speaker & i feel it is loud. No complaints regarding that.9. Battery is decent i would say. From my usage in a single charge it easily lasted me a day. But at the eod had to charge it again.10. Camera is good. It has a dual camera setup and the main camera takes good picture in outdoor lighting conditions. The images produced is sharp but i do feel it slightly over saturates the image.  This is not a deal breaker for me.11. The front camera is great & takes good selfie images. 12. For video it can record upto 4k but there is no EIS employed. Upto 1080p video it employs EIS.13. It has a physical LED notification light but it has a single white colour.14. Given the price it sells for, the inhand feel of the phone is premium and doesn't feel cheap. The phone doesn't have a glass black which also makes it less fragile.15. Gaming experience is good on this. The back slightly heats up with extensive gaming but i didn't notice any lag whatsoever with some high end games like PUBG, MORTAL KOMBAT X, NEED FOR SPEED, ASPHALT 8 & 9, CALL OF DUTY, DEAD TRIGGER 2. These ran just fine.16. Bluetooth connectivity is also great on this. I have always used with JBL Pulse 3 and never ever my connection was lost. It can easily connect to my speaker from approximately 40 linear feet.CONS.1. I like the always on display but this feature is simply not there.2. LED notification light is in a single colour which is white for all kinds of notifications3. Camera struggles a bit in artificial lighting conditions especially if the lights are less. It could have been better i feel.4. Video quality could also have been a little better than i expected but again don't get me wrong i'm just nitpicking now.5. Battery life as I've mentioned in my PROS section is decent given that I fall somewhere between a casual & heavy user. For people who are actually heavy users might face a problem.6. Doesn't have a fast charger out of the box which is disappointing. To be honest whether it supports fast charging or not i haven't tested.7. Micro usb charging, not a c-port.Overall, i would say i was a little skeptical before buying this phone as this is my first MI phone but 15 months down the line i'm happy & satisfied customer.",5.0

It works flawlessly almost 90% of time.I categorize smartphone brand into two categorize: one with limited feature with top quality for which cost is on higher side & Second are those who offer n numbers of feature but diluting the quality. But Xiaomi is a hybrid version of both offering good number of feature & also maintaining that quality factor.Pros:1. Battery lasts 1-3 days backed with 4000 mAh battery.2. 12MP+5MP Dual Rear camera with Portrait mode, HD Resolution3. Aderno 509 GPU offering 18:9 full screen resolution4. 2.5D Curved gorilla glass5. IR Remote for TVs, AC, Setup Box and more6. Finger Print & Face Unlock7. Dual speakers on Bottom of PhoneCons:1. Mi SMS does not support Gif in text (Switched to Google SMS)2. Flash is just enough for photos.3. No Unnecessary apps pre installed but once you update your smartphone it will definitely comeOpinion:1. Get a better back cover don't rely on the complimentary back cover you get.2. I suggest to safeguard your camera by lens cover as it has camera bumb which might scratch you camera lens thus destroying your camera. I have faced such issue with my moto g4 plus phone.3. Install Swift key keyboardFun Fact: Earlier we have seen trolls showing Xiaomi phone work as iron press because of heating effect. I guess they have taken this feedback too seriously :p",4.0

I hope Readme will bring back that feature very soon through system update.over all good product no heating issue or display issue found from last one year . worth for price,4.0

Anyway this is what i found so far.Pros:‚úì Budget Free ‚úì Good Camera‚úì Average Battery Life‚úì Value for moneyCons: - Security patches & MIUI is never really up to date. Every update is delayed by months.- Worst Performance. - Bad battery backup.- Mobile will be stuck for a lot of time. Usually touch will be delayed and you need to restart everytime to work.- Not as good as it was mentioned there.- Gaming is also very bad. This mobile performance is very bad when compared to the others. I am sure, this is the worst out of all the Redmi note series. It's valuable only for this price range which is expected.

6508,Worth every penny,"The mobile is excellent overall. The front camera is very powerful and the beautify option removes all pimples blemishes and elongated the face. However the back camera sucks. The battery lasts really long. I bought this in July 2018 and been using it comfortably till now. I have dropped it a few times and there's no problem. The battery is simply excellent. Initially I used to charge the phone just once in 2 days. The charging process also was fast, thanks to the fast charger they provided. However now the battery is a bit down and I need to charge it once a day. However I don't leave it for charge overnight. I wake up and put it for charge and it gets charged within 75 to 90 minutes and I'm good to go.",5.0

But it got very disappointed. quality of the phone also very poor as if you put phone from low distance by any chance, screen will be broken. It happens two times for me and changed the display for the same. I really dont know how this poor phone got this much review that too got 4.5 overall rating. After this rating only i bought which end up with this experience.

6825,Perfect product!,"Hi there.... am I am writing my review after 1year usage üòÉüòÜüòâ. Honestly speaking am truly satisfied with this Phone (üî¥except two things that I will explain in the end). Performance- This Phone runs very smoothly having no lag at all. I use to play high end games most of the time and I never faced any lag or heating issue (normally warms a bit which is ok) till today.Battery- Awesome battery backup, runs very long time as I said I use to play games. Also I watch YouTube videos, listen songs and surf internet on 4G Data. Still it manages to have some power for few calls.üêàCamera- I love the camera of this Phone, Amazing photo quality and video recording.. I have added some photo samples below üëáOverall a Good phone in this price...Now come to the point.üî¥ 2 things I don't like in this phone which I said in the starting of my review.üìç Hybrid Sim Slot-  I don't find any benefit of this idea.Why not to use extra Micro SD Slot....???Why.....Why....Why Xiaomi ...Why....¬ø¬ø¬ø???üìçCamera Bump-  Seriously speaking if you don't handle your phone with extreme care then you wd end up  braking it easily, without even your notice. So you need to have a proper back cover with a bump for camera bump...Ok ..its a short review. That's all ... Hope ur phone is in healthy condition. Bye....",5.0

7252,Delightful,"Got it for 12,999 a few months back.Value for money at this point.Performance is awesome, battery backup is good. At this price point, you can go for the newer Redmi phones tho now.A couple of cons:1. Camera is the one thing Redmi has always been behind in. It's git more megapixels, but the low light photos are pretty underwhelming.2. There's also this cheapness associated with Redmi hardware, my power button wasn't working properly after first month. And the usb port was damaged, just short of one year of using it. All of that got covered in warranty tho. But my power button is not working properly again, and the warranty period is now over for my phone SMH.Good phone, if you can ignore low light photos and if your lucky with the phone hardware.",4.0

I had to buy a Bluetooth headphone after my 5th headphone got short-circuited.5. MIUI takes up 2GB of 4GB Ram. So basically its 2GB Ram-Phone.6.

Camera quality is average as it says 13 MP in both front and back but actually the picture quality comes to be different as compared. But there's no problem with it  as the front camera gives bright pictures, whereas the back camera is also good. It gives smooth and fresh pictures! Only one thing is dissapointing that the set doesn't contain earphones but overall the phone is good and versatile! It doesn't hang frequently! If we will talk about the heating then i would say, if you will continuously use this phone for an hour then it will heat up!(not that much) so its up to you that how u r treating ur phone! Be gentle to your phone, your phone will be gentle to u.",5.0

8862,Value-for-money,Phone is good in the given price range but the battery is the main concern point in the phone. performance is ok ok not that great but decent in the price range. Xiaomi is releasing phones every quarter so it becomes outdated soon. this review is after an years use. also note that the built quality is very good and phone can handle good amount of damage. i hope they gave option in miui to remove some standard useless apps,4.0

But, once phone heats up, using is impossible. If you think to buy for major gaming, good only for a month or 2, but after that heat will irritate you. (taking bout high performance games such as PUBG Mobile) But for games like Free Fire, WCC2, Dream League Soccer,  Clash OF Clans, Mini Militia and other such games, phone is extremely fine. You can play PUBG but after heating problem may arrise. Heating maybe there within 10-15 mins of PUBG gameplay. Fine camera. Real beautiful pics. Finally, Overall, You will enjoy ur phone.

No screen bleeding issues and is comfortable for the eyes.2. Camera:: Camera is awesome at this price range.Both the front and rear camera take super. Especially, the portrait mode is awesome.3. Processor:: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 is a decent processor for gaming. I played PUBG , Asphalt 9 and many other heavy games on Medium Graphics and found seamless experience.4.MIUI 10:: It's also very good and provides good user interface.Cons:The only con is battery. It drains a bit fast but also it charges very fast.There are no other cons.Go with this phone without second thought.",5.0

9188,Not good,Not as descent as expected.I am writing review after more than 1 year of usageJust 2 pros I found in this phone1. Brilliant selfie camera2. Nice Battery lifeNo other pros I foundCons1. Bad rear camera2. Low performance3. Hybrid sim slot force you to choose from 2 sims or 1 sim and memory card4. Design isn't attractiveIt actually deserves 1 star but selfie camera has increased the rating,2.0
9189,Could be way better,Not upto the markI am writing review after 1+ year of useIt has nice selfie camera but the rear camera is too low in quality which is really disappointing. The performance is also average not highAlthough it has 2.5 D display but still the look is not attractive.I am disappointed with this phone.It actually deserve 1 star but 1 extra star is given only because of brilliant selfie camera,2.0

9543,Useless product,I am changing my review for this Redmi product after using around 6 months. I really hate Redmi product after using Redmi note 5 pro by using it around 6monts.Region behind- 1)It's performance become bullsit2)Too much heating camera is also getting worst. 3)Unnecessary adds popup in its browser not any option to select different default browser makes me so irritated. I think Redmi making their customers fool by unnecessary updates in products I'm not going to buy and recommend any one to buy Redmi product.,1.0

The performance of Redmi phones degrade automatically within a year, heating and freezing of screen issues are very frequent and it has one of the worst UI ever made, they advertise even on AppLock screen and that is very very irritating so go for Samsung or other brands cuz you have to switch within a year as it will stop satisfying you really early.",2.0

9943,Great product,"Best flagship phone under 20kBox includes:Phone, Data cable, Soft transparent back cover, wall power adapter and user manual.Pros:+ Super smart phone+ Excellent build quality+ Gorgeous display+ Very good rear camera with DSLR grade bokeh, it is one of the best under 25K.+ Sleek, sturdy and very premium+ One of the best selfie in the market under 25K.+ No heat, no lagging.+ Dual band WiFi+ Smooth performance from SD-636 coupled with 6GB RAM.+ Great connectivity package - 4G, Dual SIM, FM Radio, WiFi+ Above average sunlight legibility.Cons:- No Oreo out of the box.- No NFC- Protruding camera lens- Average speaker loudness.I don't see any mobile as good as this under 25K except last year's Huawei flagships Huawei P9 and Honor 8, with heavily discounted price on some sites these have become equally value for money options and Samsung Galaxy S7.Huawei phones have better cameras, same performance and NFC and better low light photography but with smaller display size and and no FM.S7 has better display which vivid and more punchy, double resolution, superior camera, 4K video recording, better low light photography and Samsung Pay.Easily recommended under 20K. phonePros:Gorgeous DisplayGreat Camera Quality under daylight conditionsExcellent Battery BackupNo lag while multi-tasking and gamingFast and Accurate Face unlockCons:No fast chargingHybrid Sim SlotRatings:Design: 8/10Display: 9/10Sound: 8.5/10Battery: 10/10Back Camera: 9/10Front Camera: 9/10Processor: 10/10Call Quality: 9/10Face Unlock and Fingerprint: 9/10Sound from Speakers: 10/10Sound from Earphones: 8/10Pricing: 10/10Overall Rating: 9/10Deailed Review: So here's what you get inside the box:1. Handset2. Charger (5V, 2amps)[ A fast charger would have been better ]3. USB charging cable4. Sim ejector pin5. A translucent soft case[ Thanks to Xiaomi for providing a free case ]Design:The design of the phone is not great but not bad as well. It looks very decent. I like the 2.5D glass on the front which gives it a premium look. The phone is slightly taller than Redmi Note 4 but the width is a bit smaller. It is easier to hold because of the smaller width but because of extra height and bigger display, reaching the top of the display is difficult with one hand. Most of the time you will be using both hands with this phone. Overall the design is good and I would give it 8/10.Display:The display is large 5.99 inch with 18:9 aspect ratio and Full HD+ resolution. The display is beautiful and sharp. The viewing angles are good and it is sufficiently bright for read properly under sunlight. I didn't like the inbuilt wallpapers so used OnePlus 5T and LG G6 wallpapers which look great.Display Rating: 9/10Sound:The sound output from speakers is excellent. The speakers are loud and clear. Xiaomi has made great improvement here compared to previous Redmi Note 3 and Note 4.The sound output from 3.5mm headphone jack is good. Tip: Use sound enhancer in settings to improve sound quality.The call quality and clarity was great as well both on speaker and earphones.Battery:The battery lasted for 1.5 days with medium to heavy usage. SOT( Screen On Time) was more than 8 hours which is excellent.Camera:The dual back camera is very impressive and can compete with OnePlus 5T. Pictures are sharp and have plenty of details. Portrait mode works really well and pictures look great.The front camera is a 20MP sensor and it takes some great pictures. The beautify effect works well. The front camera also has a portait mode and gives a nice blur effect. Front flash was useful in low light conditions and improved selfie quality.Processor:The Snapdragon 636 chipset is a beast. You won't face any lag at all even while using multiple apps and games.Face Unlock:I updated the phone just after starting it and face unlock update was there. It registered face data very quickly which was a surprise. Till now it is working great. I tried it with 2-3 other people and they were not able to open the phone. It is quick(unlocks in less than a second.) One thing I liked about it was that it worked great even when my phone was around my waist height and it detects your face. You don't have to bring it to face level which is annoying.Overall, Redmi Note 5 Pro is an excellent value for money device with good looks, great camera, long battery life, powerful chipset. I don't think we will see a better smartphone under 20000 this year. Go for it if your budget is 20000.",5.0
9944,Excellent,best mobile at this budget...,5.0
9945,Wonderful Mid range Budget smartphone.,"So, I have used this mobile for about 3 weeks and here's what i have to sayFirst will go with thePros:1. Front camera is Simply Fabulous (Safe to say better than One plus 5-t , And As good as S9+) *Tested before conclusion*2. Good processing speed.3. Handles most of high graphic online games.4. Good for watching movies,YouTube and Surfing web, Social media.5. Doesnt heat up like previous xiaomi devices.6. Potrait mode is simply awesome in good lighting conditions.7. Good Network catching.8. Holds Charge for upto 8 hrs of continuous usage (*With INTERNET*)Cons: (Bugs found)1. Its safe to say Xiaomi does provide a back case with the mobile But As lots of reviews says its true that it doesnt guard the Back Camera Bump enough (IPHONE X COPY)2. The front camera as said is awesome, However it does lag some times when there is high exposure , and when launched for the first time(*Sometimes)3. Detailed: a.Rear camera does good job with portrait mode,(ONLY IN BRIGHT LIGHT), Let alone the potrait mode , The back camera itself feels like some cheap china phone camera in low light.b. Potrait mode does struggles to focus some times Which does give some damn Blurred pictures .Every 4/10 times to be precise.4. Gaming is good . But, Games like Bullet force (Online FPS) does lag at some points in Medium-High Graphics settings, Rules of Survival does play well.5.BLOATWARES since its MIUI(Still on Nougat) there are hell lot of Bloatwares with damn Ads , So people like me will definitely hate those.6.Design is good as Always but the phone itself is a bit heavy. compared to s9+, Oneplus and many other similar phones. So i would recommend some serious protective case, because it is sure to crumble to pieces once it falls with force.7. I am using the 6GB version, and Processing with most apps are good but still i did find quite some issues:   a.When you fully customize the theme with 6 different themes and change the wallpaper for home screen and Lock screen with ur choice      Using it for some 20 mins changes back to default  (MOST ANNOYING NEEDS TO BE FIXED WITH PRIORITY)   b. It did hang untill i had to reboot it , when i had rebooted it since an app wouldnt launch (Bullet force).Conclusion:If you dont care about the bloatware and whole (Iphone 1st  copy ""MIUI""), plus You want a mobile for its good looks and if u like to take a lot of selfies+Pics outdoors in daylight and play decent amount of games + Browse. and need a good reliable battery + in a hurry to buy a mobile from this generation to get rid of old mobile (Like me) go for it.If you had used Stock android b4, Play intense games, Need perfect camera/Highly durable Build quality, and a phone u will use for more than a year,Please wait for better Xiaomi model (MIA2) or buy One plus 6T in EMI option.Thanks For reading!",4.0

The problem in phone start when I have started calling. During call phone leave the network in between the call for sometime. I have raised the issue and demand for replace the phone but call operator suggest me some steps to resolve the problem and grant additional 3 days for replace the phone and initially reject my request. After doing the same steps there is no improvement in the phone. Now flipkart not allow me to replace the phone and I m with the dabba phone. Flipkart and redmi both cheated me.",1.0
9970,Perfect product!,"I have to say this is the best sexy looking device that I have used ever. Xiaomi just nailed it. The main attraction of Redmi Note 5 Pro is the display with great in-hand-feel. Talking about the display its is bright(under sun) and gets dim as low as possible at night.Snapdragon 636 SOC is a very much battery efficient phone. A clean successor to Snapdragon 625SOC. I have upgraded from LENOVO P2 to Redmi Note 5 Pro last week. Except the battery the rest Redmi Note 5 Pro excels, battery LENOVO P2 is having that extra 1100mAh takes an edge. Camera is awesome in Redmi Note 5 Pro. I took Redmi Note 5 Pro 6GB version intentionally because for a future perspective its on the safer, more settling sideFew Positives that I found in Redmi Note 5 Pro+SD 636- low heating and stellar performance than SD625+6GB RAM- the extra 2GB of RAM can hold upto 39 apps (including high end games) in memory.+MiUi 9- feels light and very much responsive.+Battery- The 4000mAH battery is just outstanding when compared to many high end phones like OP5t+Camera- The bokeh and depth-of-feel are top notch.+Front flash- It is an added advantage to take selfies in No-Light scenarios.+Fingerprint- The fastest in the segment, can even beat speed against the higher priced flagships.+Video Recording- the Electronic Image Stabilisation(EIS) gives an outstanding video recording experience. +Weight- The phone feels light to hold on.Negatives of Redmi Note 5 Pro-Only Fast Charge 2.0 available-no 4K recording-Face unlock is just a hit or a miss(it unlocks to all my family members)-6GB version when compared to 4GB is 3K Rupee more, which has no upgrade in ROM as welland the biggest con is FLASH SALE its like a lottery :)",5.0

9972,Classy product,"This is one of the best decision i have ever took in my life. I've chosen Redmi Note 5 Pro 6GB Vairent because i knew there will be less candidate to buy this phone and having extra ram isn't bad even it makes your phone more smoother. Even there is a huge difference in Antutu Benchmark test if you'll compare it with 4 GB Ram Model if you have extra 3K buck do invest in it I know its bit costly but you won't regret it .Now Coming back to phone. I'll divide it in pros and cons.PRO's : (since it's a pro version that's why pros are more) :1) Camera: Camera is definitely the highlighting point of this device. The picture quality is increased by 1000% if compared with earlier Xiaomi devices that bad xiaomi was used to be in camera but with this one the camera is excellent. Even the front camera is tremendous. Trust me you won't find anything like this in camera in this price segment not even with Oppo Vivo Selfie camera which they clame to be the best. This Is simply Mind Blowing.2)  Proccessor : Now coming to the Proccessor this was powered by Snapdragon 636 Chipset i was bit curious to test it out and to be honest it's better than Snapdragon 650/651 which was present in Mi Max since i was using Mi Max from 2 years and i have compared both of them but 636 seems to be more fluent.3) Design : The Design if i have to sum up the design in Ekta kapoors style All i would say is ""Haaaaayyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeee"" It looks damn damn damn awesome. Even  with applying the back cover which xiaomi provided it looks best and i would recommend to use it with cover it will safe your camera since camera is bit out do it will save the lens.4) Battery : Battery also one of the highlighting Point since i was having Mi Max with 4850 Battery this one is having 4000 only but it still it competes with mi max neck to neck infact it's slightly better than Mi Max. And it does support quick Charge I cant really say Quick Charge 2.0 or 3.0 but i'll test it out and edit the review and inform you in 3 4 days5) Sensor : One of the best part about Xiaomi Devices are they never skip any sensor in fact with this one it comes with all the neccessary Sensors. Which is great.Overall This Is One of the Best phone ever. It's worth waiting for.Before coming to Cons let me tell you some might say its not having USB type C is a con but for me it isn't since it hardly matter what type of Port they are using for charging infact the one which is present is easily accessible everywhere.Cons : DO LET ME KNOW IF YOU FIND ANY.And to those who are trying to buy this one keep trying guys this phone is worth waiting for ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èAnd the Delivery was quick too Thanks to FlipkartAnd Thakyou Xiaomi for making such devicesWith LoveMI FAN ‚ù§Ô∏è",4.0

9982,Good quality product,"Alright honest review after using for more then 2 months I use the 6GB version very well balanced phone with all round features and performance battery life is fabulous as expected but the best part is there is a significant improvement is in the camera and sound department which was always a problem in previous version.The dual rear camera does a pretty decent Job in getting good quality pictures and the various modes of camera also adds to the effect and the 20MP selfie camera does a good Job in selfies also although there are better phones in the market with much better camera specs i still recommend this phone because this is a well rounded phone If some people still have problems with the quality of the camera please buy a DSLR or a digital camera it still is cheaper compared to other phone models The sound quality is good and loud although i feel it lacks a bit when using headphones but they can be compensated with Mi accessories head phones the SD  636  Chip set  does a fabulous Job any games,apps or just browsing the phone opening multiple windows the phone does it with ease whether you use 4GB or 6GB it doesn't make a difference there's no lag hanging its fast efficient and power efficient The OS is also light simple and intelligent which coupled with the power efficient chip-set helps in consuming the battery efficiently resulting in a battery life which will easily last for 1.5 to 2 days for a heavy user (yes it does last that long ) Well the cons are pretty basic They should have had a C-type connector as USB type adapter given does not have fast charging, But the phone supports fast charging so you can get a full days charge while charging for a hr The flash sale is a big scam as rarely genine users get to buy the phone Flipkart & Mi should take stringent steps to give more qty on flash sales Bottom line is simple There are lot of smart phones in the market with better camera and bigger processor but don't waste your money and go fir this as this is a bang on value for money with excellent battery life and performance which none of the other smart phones provide and has a very good cameras I personally cannot ask for a better camera for a phone if you want better then it makes sense buying a camera",4.0
9983,Terrific purchase,"Please read complete review so it might be helpful for someone.  Recently bought Redmi Note 5 Pro 6GB RAM variant (coz I always wanted to buy that phone even in the market best options are available). Like everyone,  I was also confused between which phone to buy? ( specially Nokia 6.1 Plus, Honor, etc..) but I made my mind up and purchased this beast. Pros:  1. As previous MI user I went for Pro 5 which helps me to restore all data as it is in new model.  2. Superb Performance (6GB) RAM,  no lags,  everything smooth functioning. 3. Good Battery back-up,  depends upon how you use it & other things like network connection which consumes alot. But if you charge in the morning it lasts a day till sleep. 4. Full HD display (top notch is just a thing,  don't think it is necessary & unavoidable - screen looks better & complete without it). 5. MIUI - not everyone likes Stock Android,  some people like customization. MIUI is best in giving more features. 6. Superb Audio quality (speaker),  no doubt I can hear sound from long distance which was the main reason I changed my old model. 7. Not C Type but micro USB does charges good.  My phone charges completely in 2.5 hrs. Also I used to connect OTG Pendrive often so it helps me alot. 8. Selfies are best,  Front LED is there, not having more expectation from this kind of budget.  It offers more than its value. Cons: 1. Camera is good but color contrasts are very high which takes away originality from photos. 2. Also don't know whether this phone works in other countries with different sim cards. Apart from this I dont find any problem in this phone which offers best in its budget. Nokia 6.1 Plus is also good compare to built quality but it fails in battery & RAM offering. Performance is same compare to Pro5, also camera quality is there. Screen is little big of Pro 5,  smartphone must be smart to fit in hands. But gesture options I really liked. Now it depends on each individual choices,  like I regretted when they launched Nokia and Most awaited smartphone of the year POCO F1 but after using my pro5 I'm completely satisfied right now!  For next 2 years I don't need to worry about replacing this beast phone (hope they gives Android P but MIUI 10 updates will fill that void) or someone offers me POCO F1 in giveaway üòú.  Go for Black Color only, looks premium. - Honest review from Happy Customer. if any queries,  please feel free to ask!  üëç",5.0

Amazing display quality,  amazing battery backup, quick charging takes almost 2hours to be fully charged. Lots of specific features are there. Camera of this phone killer one. What a perfection. Clear with bokeh effect with portrait mode for both rear and front. Nice build quality with firm grip on phone looks smartest. Thanks Xiaomi to provide a beautiful soft case.

I luckily got this in 8th flash sale 6gb black variant it's so fast and smooth.camera is also the best part of this phone both front and rear camera   is capable of taking great shots with enough details. processor is capable of what you have thrown on it just ready for that,also the best part of this phone is battery back up is really nice it's last long one day with heavy usage you have to charge it with small top ups don't drain battery with zero percent ever charge your phone to 30-80% it will improve the battery life. overall it's a best phone in the market available right now, only a big concern is availablity of the phone only via flash sale but don't cry friends keep trying and when u will get the phone hands on difinitely you will smile.

10008,Good,"A COMPLETE PACKAGE!!!!THIS REVIEW IS PURLY WRITTEN BY ME AND IS NOT COPIED. SO READ CAREFULLY1) IN BOX CONTENT:- We get headset, soft case and charger which of course is not a fast charger, company should include it as the phone support fast charging but still.2) PHYSICAL OVERVIEW:- The phone looks premium and slim the inhand feeling of this phone is also good. I would suggest you to buy gold color as it looks more premium and is not finger print magnet.3) DISPLAY:- It comes with an 18:9 modern display which is very sharp and crisp. Brightness is also very good and screen is visible under direct sunlight.4) PERFORMANCE:- Now here things gets interesting as the phone is powered by snapdragon 636 which is a beast. You will not face any lag or glitch while playing heavy games and go for 6 gb ram variant if you have to use phone for long time.5) BATTERY:- Like the previous year's redmi note 4 , this phone also has an expectional battery life. If you are a causual user you will easily get 2 days of battery life. Charging speed is bit slow with the default charger hence I would suggest to buy a fast charger6) CAMERA:- Now coming to main highlight of this phone which is of course camera, now taking about front camera, it is excellent and captures great pictures, front flash is also a bonus as it helps under low lighting conditions.Coming to rear camera , it's good but not as good as it is hyped, it captures natural colors and performs well under good lighting conditions but in low light it doesn't perfom that great, yes it's camera is improved from it's predecessor but I expected more.Verdict:- performance is great , display is great , battery is great , camera is good.NOTE:- During flash sales you should buy 6gb variant due to less competitionUSB type C port is also not there which can be counted as a con",3.0

10040,Unsatisfactory,"Bought this phone after reading reviews and also from past experiences of owning other Redmi phones.I started using this phone and after about three-four days I noticed the image retention problem. Since the 10 days replacement period had already expired, I went to MI service centre. Their solution, downgrade OS to a lower version. Came back home knowing fully well that it was the panel (Screen) problem, but service centre was not convinced. They told me to use it for few days and then report.Guess I have to go again to service centre. Let's see what solution/excuse they have to offer, now that the problem is still there.UPDATE:- Went to service centre again and got the panel (Screen) replaced. The new panel is from Shenchao, but the new panel has a yellow tint to it under default settings.The earlier panel was of Tianma, and that seems to have image retention/ghosting problem. Changing the mode to cool for new panel seems to work.Also when I received this phone, the soft cover that came with the phone was defective and I was promised some cash back by Flipkart and I have email from them regarding this. After the 10 days were over, they refused to give me the cash back or change of soft cover.There was a time when Flipkart used to take care of its customers really well, but now their standards are falling.Anyone from Flipkart reading this:- Pull up your act. Don't promise what you cannot deliver. Listen to your customers.",1.0
10041,Utterly Disappointed,"After 3 months Camera stopped working, It didn't work even after sending bug to Mi for analysis. Very disappointed with this.",1.0
10042,Unsatisfactory,"Initially this mobile was good, but a month back they gave software update 9.2.7,after that this mobile now sucks. Portrait mode has become pathetic and horrible,half image is blurred and rest is normal. Mobile has started heating a lot. Rear camera quality has been degraded. It was told that to fix this users will be given 9.5 update in the mid April. But today is 8th May, still no sign of it. If rumours are to be believed this mobile will be getting update in June or July. I think I did blunder in buying this cheap mobile. Would not recommend any one to buy this. On paper it's specs might look good, but it's not. The software update has totally ruined this phone. Xiaomi is the worst company to manufacture mobile phones, what more you can expect from a Chinese company. I guess, I am stuck with this and paying the price for it. This is my  last Xiaomi mobile in this life.",1.0

10049,Pretty good,Great value for money. Ordered 6GB variant in 7th March sale & was delivered to me on 11th March. Ordered in my first attempt.Great product at great price. I am very happy with its performance. One think I didn't liked in this is that Xiaomi is not providing fast charger with it. Even phone has fast charging out of the box it only charges 20 min faster than the ordinary charger & if Mi A1 is having type C charger why Note 5 Pro is missing it. They must have put type C charging port in it.Overall very much happy with the product.,4.0

Having OS Stock Android would have made this phone invincible against others in such price range. Camera (rear & front) are good. Selfie quality is better than MI A1 and Max 2.

10108,Great product,"that phone is good enough for regular use.nice display,premium looking,overall good camera(for a 15k phn it is quite awsm),smooth performance (using it for 3days and with heavy games and apps it never lagged)..pros:1.good camera(probably mi a1 and asus laser is better)..front camera is a beast really2.smooth performance3.best display and looks in that price segment4.miui9 is also very user friendlycons:1.no dedicated memory slot.nowadays for hardcore gamers and social networking gen 52gb(which is available internal storage) will be full within a few months..2.battery is just average...lasting for near 24hrs with wifi and data on..while with game it lasts for 16-18hrs..3.rear camera is not up to the mark like redmi a1 or asus laser models..even nokia's zeiss lens was better than that...Overall that phone is best for regular users and selfie lovers..if u r a mid range buyer with budget not more than 20k...must go for it...im satisfied with the phone...(though i was using zenfone ar..it got damaged after 8 months..and i got full 50k back in my account...no mobile can beat asus zenfone ar)...",5.0
10109,Best Phone under 20K,"Overall very good experience. Awesome camera quality with portrait mode as well as with selfie mode. Battery life is really good, even with the excessive use battery does not drain out in one day. Charging is fast but can be increased with Qualcomm quick charger 2.0 (which is not provided with the phone). Face unlock is not fast and fully dependable but fingerprint censor is quite impressive with its quick response. Looks and design is very stylish and is must buy phone in this price segment. Phone is quite fast because of the 6gb ram so if you confused about spending extra 3k for the extra 2gb ram i would suggest you to go for it.",5.0

Redmi note 5 pro is a with Zero body Grip the phone is designed in such a way that its can easily slips from your hand and as soon as it hits the ground , kaboom, Shattered display as soon as i took out the phone from box i was trying to click a selfie but my thumb was hardly able to reach the shutter button on screen and the phone fell to the ground , i knkw maybe it could b my fault but nevertheless i have seen such a bad grip of any phone and the display itself got no protection.

10134,EXCELLENT IS THE WORD !,"I bought this phone almost 3 weeks ago and I think I am eligible to write a review for REDMI NOTE 5 PRO (6/64GB(LAKE BLUE). Let's talk about some PROS First :‚óèThe 5.99-inch Full HD+ IPS display ‚Äì2160 x 1080 resolution translating to a pixel density of 403ppi. The display is bright, and the colors are quite vivid with deep contrasts. The text and images are sharp and the color accuracy is Spectacular. sunlight legibility is excellent. There‚Äôs also Gorilla Glass scratch protection.‚óèMoving on to the design, well, it‚Äôs the camera setup on the back. many say it looks a lot like the setup on the iPhone X( F**k iphone X) here i can say iphone X mostly copy From mi mix 2 bezel-less design . Anyways, there‚Äôs a lot to like about the Redmi Note 5 Pro design. Single hand use is easier than i expected since it's a gigantic six inch display. The curves make holding the phone really comfortable. Yes, it‚Äôs a metal build.‚óèRedmi Note 5 Pro is the first Smartphone by the company powered by Qualcomm‚Äôs latest Snapdragon 636 processor With a new GPU Adreno 508 which was announced in October last year. In real-world usage, the Redmi Note 5 Pro powers through anything that is thrown at it. Multi-tasking on the Redmi Note 5 Pro is a breeze, There‚Äôs no performance lag at all.‚óèMoving on to the highlight of the Redmi Note 5 Pro. THE CAMERA. A 12 MP f/2.2 + 5 MP f/2.0 dual camera setup with a dual LED flash. The primary camera captures 1.25 micron pixels, The rear camera on the Redmi Note 5 Pro is EXCELLENT, especially in good lighting conditions. The color reproduction is very good at most times and there‚Äôs a good level of detail. The Portrait Mode on the Redmi Note 5 Pro is a winner though. The depth effect comes out excellent in most cases and the sharpness is just right. The edge detection is accurate. The Redmi Note 5 Pro is its 20 MP front camera. Capture some brilliant selfies with the right depth effect.‚óèMIUI is one of the more popular Android customizations, I love MIUI more over stock android. I must say a well optimized MIUI. My favorite MIUI features like native app locker, screen recorder, themes, second space, dual apps, etc. ‚óèBattery that‚Äôs another area where the Redmi Note 5 Pro EXCELS. The 4,000 mAh battery on the Redmi Note 5 Pro should easily last me a day or even more than a day, even on my heavy usage. (REMEMBER I AM VERY HEAVY USER ). Redmi Note 5 Pro is the fact that it supports Quick Charging. Redmi Note 5 Pro went from 20 to 100 % in around 1 hour 38 minutes and I use QuantumZERO WalMATE Quick Charge QC3.0‚óèGreat signal reception ‚óèSpeaker is loud enough ‚óèRam management is excellent . There will always 3.5gb ram available for use.CONS:‚óèThe bundled charger does not fast charger. ‚óèThe microUSB port. I mean it‚Äôs 2018.",5.0

Initially I had a hard time buying it because of flash sale it was only available for 2-3 minutes maximum for huge demand but finally I got through. Talking about the phone inside th box I got a free back cover the charger wire could be a little long coz short charger is not by good for all. The product is so kool superb graphics with online game like pubg, rules of survival, no latency issue even if you have multiple application running in the background goof screen size fits inside the pocket doesn't looks odd. sound quality is superb battery backup is solid please do not charge with other stick to the one you get with the product try not to is powerbank coz they have different voltage power which is not good for phones unless you know what is the right one to use. camera is superb with inbuilt various modes from iPhone. gesture unlock is kool that let's you more security. Anyone looking for a trendy high performance phone within 25k budget this is what you should have although th Phn only cost me 17k.

10192,Fabulous!,In Love with the Shape of it‚ù§,5.0
10193,Good quality product,"After using for seven days, here is my little review. Pros:1. Camera is a big plus. With 20 MP, the front camera is a winner and even the rear dual camera (12+5 MP) takes great photo. There is a flashlight even in the front, so that you can even take selfies in the dark. But the night photography is more suitable with the rear dual camera with RGB sensors. 2. 6GB RAM variant has the touch of silk. No lag experienced in any of the apps or games upto now (though I've spend little time on gaming). Even 4GB RAM variant is more than sufficient, I hear.3. Though the phone comes with Nougat, an Oreo update is already published. You have to just update the phone.4.  Display is 18:9, which is very welcome. This is the first time Xiaomi has launched such an aspect ratio in their phones.5. As per the specs, it uses Corning Gorilla Glass, which is a good improvement. But will feel better if Xiaomi would have disclose which version. Better use a tempered glass. 6. Though Type C port is not used, charging is quite fast. Takes about some one hour plus time for a full charge.7. Extremely good looking and lightweight. The metal finish back is designed upon iPhone X and the result is quite elegant.8. EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization) is included in the phone, which make the pictures quite perfect. Cons:1. Poor poor phone volume. Redmi deployed only a minimal mono speaker in the phone, and the volume is quite low.  Its even worse with a headphone on. If listening music one of your priority, stay away from this phone. PS: Upon review from the users, Redmi had tried to address the issue (with MIUI 9.0.5 update), but the problem is still on. Currently, its MIUI 9.5 update in circulation, but you can still listen very low with headphone up. 2. Boasted as a 'battery beast',  this beast  delivers 12- 14 hrs max on a single charge under moderate/ heavy usage. Under extreme usage, when gaming is involved, the battery life should be even shorter. It is a disappointing thing to happen for a 4000mAh battery. Are you using a  real 4000 mAh battery, Xiaomi? PS: This is the first phone in world to useSnapdragon 636 processor. Untested before, this processor maybe a reason for such a poor battery show. Will wait for Mi if anything they could do to upgrade performance with their updates. :(3. Rear camera is protruding out, which is prone to heavy scratches, if the phone is usually kept in rear down position. The protective silicon cover, which is provided with the phone is barely protect the lens from scratches, let alone protect from a fall.  Using a fall proof cover is a must.4. No optical zoom in the rear camera, only digital zoom is present, which is quite dissappointing as its earlier avatar has already had a 2X optical zoom.5. No Type-C port, Redmi Note 5 Pro is still using the age old mini USB port for charging. Therefore compromising with data and charging speed.6. Video recording has a 'Short Video' feature for recording 10 s clip, but what it lacks is the absence of 4K video recording. Which was present even in the below variant Redmi Note 5. 7. Worthless and cheap looking SIM slot. Redmi is still using the same hybrid over and over again. Be cautious while inserting SIM. The slot may break.8. The 6 GB variant is unreasonably high priced. Paying 3K+ bucks more is too much for a 2GB upgradation.In overall, A fair phone with some good and some bad features in it.  if you are a casual photographer, try for it. But if you are a music lover, stay away.",4.0
10194,Cheated by the flipkart,I was online shopping a phone redimi pro5 from you.but I realised that that product was defective I want to return that product and I apply for that on time.

10203,Wonderful,"Awesome product. You can not ask a better product at this price. All the necessary specifications are present in this phone which one needs in day to day usage. I am particularly impressed by battery and camera performance. I have 6GB RAM version so I need not worry about multi tasking. I have been using it now for around 25 days, My observations are as follows: ‚óè I play heavy games all the time and even after having 3 4 games in background, still around 2 GB RAM stays free all the time. Even the most resource consuming games work smoothly on this phone, all thanks to LPDDR4X 6GB RAM and Snapdragon 636! ‚óè Rear dual Camera is great for the price. Portrait shots give though competition even to the likes of One plus 5t. ‚óè Call quality, network reception and loudspeaker performance is up to the mark. Not too good, not too bad. ‚óè 6 inch screen in 18:9 aspect ratio is an eye candy specially in black color variant. Gorilla Glass is present so I would suggest to use Mi screen protector instead of Tempered glass.‚óè Front camera gets the job done wonderfully, even the most demanding selfy enthusiast would be satisfied with the performance of front camera.‚óè Battery is good. I get full day of heavy usage and I play a lot of heavy games, such as Sky force reloaded, Angry birds transformers, Shadow fight 2 etc. So I think moderate usage would yield me around 1.5 to 2 days of battery life.‚óè I personally don't like MI Launcher so I use Google now Launcher which I recommend to everyone.‚óè One thing which I don't like about this phone is 'screen mirror/cast' option. I think this is the problem with all the 18:9 display phones. Your screen would not mirror on a standard LED TV on full screen, you are left with wide black space around the cast screen which is frustrating as I am fond of playing movies and videos on my TV screen but it is not pleasing on this phone. May be Mi would fix the issue in coming weeks. Other than this, Phone is absolutely awesome for this price. Go for it without second thought.",5.0

At this budget too Samsung or other brands  have better phones. if the budget is less still go for Samsung J7 Max or Pro. Not a very user friendly phone. Another disadvantage is that Xiaomi has a very poor resale value. So better pay a little more for some better brand and be compensated while resale. The way this phone is being sold thru flash sale is just to create hype. I have yet not availed after sale service so that shud be another imp area to be considered while buying a phone. so see other reviews for this purpose who must hv used their service centre services.",2.0

10237,Worth the money,The Phone Is Nice!!! I have been using stock android devices but wanted use MI phones for a different experience!! and it paid well.. I am not a gamer but memory management is important... So go for these device... But delivery of Flipkart is pathetic.. recieved phone late.. And in small cities the delivery boys are lazy...Olx is having more stock than Flipkart!!!,4.0
10238,Very Good,"Got the 6 GB RAM variant today.. Ordered yesterday, so one day delivery. Thumbs up to flipkart for that.. Now coming to phone first thing I want to say is this time the flash sale is really nasty, couldn't get a 4 GB variant after multiple tries, so finally went for the 6 GB variant which is clearly over priced, Xiaomi could easily give 128 GB storage at that price.. So thumbs down for Xiaomi, now about the quality of the phone, I also own Mi A1 and the material quality in MI a1 is clearly much better. A1 gives premium feel while holding, on the other hand note 5 pro is OK, nothing special the metal used at back is of cheap quality, also the bezels could be thinner, but Xiaomi intentionally make them broader because they will implement thinner Bezel in their upcoming MI A2 which again is going to be a premium device in bidget.. Now coming to software and hardware part.. Miui is cool, and the phone performs as per the specifications... Overall a nice buy",4.0

Overall phone is average, as with 6 GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage, it is expected to have a great performance.  Haven't started exploring other feature, but assume to be okay with RedMI over all reviews and reputation. The reason I am writing this review is for those who dont want to buy a heavy phone.  Guys this my heaviest phone I have ever used in last 10 years of smart phone usage.  Hence if you looking for a lighter phone then this is not an option, as it will definitely increase weight in your pocket and for your hand if your is heavy usage.  I some time have to hold it with both the hands due to its size and weight.",3.0

I see greenish white flashes during the gameplay which is quite annoying whereas my previous Redmi 4 played it with better quality.

(wake up xiaomi). Lacks in artificial intelligence. where other brands are ruling camera world with AI. battery is fantastic.display is good. though black color is popular, blue color is awesome finish.for 2000 extra 6gb version is not value for money. but 6gb version perform much better than 4gb. they could have gave 128gb option also.xiaomi lacks in releasing new updates for the fastest selling phone model? come on xiaomi. we are waiting to buy your product in this competitive environment and you don't think about our needs and giving updates. unfair. Call quality is good.audio is loud enough but on higher volume it lacks in quality of sound. headphone sound performs fantastic. HD quality.processor performance is up to mark and no lacks in daily performance. inspite I don't play games and high memory apps.after Oreo update, whatsapp crashes frequently. xiaomi team need to fix this.one need to buy better back cover as free stuff is not worthy.

One night, after an OTA update, the phone was running in background through out the night and eventually the battery came to 2%. After capturing market share, Xiaomi seems like reducing the quality.

11025,Beast under 20k,Best Smartphone under 20k.My Genuine Review after using it.I am using it almost since 15days and here is my detailed review about it.First of all I liked the phone since the day one. The display is too good with vibrant colours. Talking about the camera the back camera is pretty good and captures decent pictures(saying decent because I am using a Iphone 7plus user). About the front camera it takes good selfies with depth effect and yes low light selfies are also good because of it front flash. I dont know whats the problem with front camera but whenever I take it outside and click pictures in daylight after few clicks it lags in depth effect. I think its a software glitch and will be resolved in upcoming updates.About the processor the SD 636 with 6gb is really a beast along with GPU. It doesnt get that hot while playing games and remains just under 40degrees.The loudspeaker is loud enough and the earpiece speaker is also good. The only drawback about sound is its 3.5mm headphone jack. The output is really bad. When I connect it with my hometheatre the sound output is almost 50% low compared to iphone or other phones. Even I tried my Powerbeats 3 the sound isnt that great via bluetooth also. Dont know whats the problem with output.The 4000MAH battery is again a beast. If you charge the phone to 100% then one can use it for the whole day on LTE  with decent gaming and surfing still the  battery remains 30%after almost 8-10hrs of usage. Which is great with such a huge display. Let me know if anyone wants to know anything about it. Thank You.,5.0

11048,Super!,I got the 6 GB model as was able to get it instead of 4 GB on Flash sale. And I don't regret it. The phone is fast and smooth with the famous MIUI. Battery life is awesome and easily goes more than a day with my kind of use with LTE data on. packaging is pretty neat and I like the fact that they provide a silicon cover right in the box so that you are protected from day 0. would have great if glass screen guard was also provided. Coming to the camera the bokeh mode works pretty well and edge detection was accurate apart from few exceptions. Tested the Face unlock feature and it works fine too.,5.0

11080,Brilliant,"First  i had a doubt in my mind  abt this product how it gonna satisfy my needs but now after using this  mobile i got a clear vision abt this phone its features r excellent and one more thing it will be very useful mobile for office ppl because everything is inbuilt don't worry abt installing separate apps .It gives u  iphone x feel if u buy black colour ,camera features r insane worth a buy for 17k",5.0
11081,Does the job,"OK, before the review, the only reason I bought this is because 2 bikers in Bangalore snatched my Oneplus 5T and could not do anything. So I had to opt for a cheap alternative. So here are few points to remember before buying - 1. Asus zenfone 5 has the same chipset and better design. If you already own a good phone wait till its launched. 2. If you think a 6GB variant will be faster than 4GB, think again. The processing power of the chipset is maxed at 1.8GHz. No point in spending that 14K. But yes it will be usuful for heavy gaming or long video recording with lesser noise.3. Do not buy the white variant.4. It actually has a strange GPU of Adreno 509, which is an upgrade from previous, but still less powerful than 510. 5. No capacitive buttons for navigation. The bezel is much bigger than required.6. The phone is heavy and the plastic back is not a good thing to hold or to look at.7. Camera for the normal and novice users will have mixed results. But night shots will be terrible, still usable.8. The front flash is not good enough. I would have preferred if the whole screen got lit up which might have produced better images.9. So far no official India ROM for Oreo which could be a little blowback, since Mi A1 had that.10. The fingerprint sensor while works great is too small for the purpose.11. No Type C connector. Its actually a prehistorical design.So on to the review -This is a super fast lag free phone. The reason I got the 6 GB variant, cause I had a better shot at buying it. But I see no point now, and do think I should have gone for the 4 GB variant. There is a small lag while loading apps like playstore and chrome, but that is due a lower clockspeed of the processor, which is preoccupied with the apps in memory, and cannot juice up the internet speed. So the most important point is that if you feel there is a lag int the phone, try downloading big files and check the network connection. I absolutely hate the Mi Cloud, since google already has it, it was a pointless bloatwire. I absolutely love the daytime shots from both the camera, but I am using some of the XDA apps. The bulit in camera is  disappointing. Also there is a way to get customized watermark and google how to do so. The sreen is bright but not bright enough at direct sunlight. The color management is also not what I expected it to be. The biggest letdown is the sound equalizer which does not work with Bluetooth Devices, and even normal speakers with 3.5 mm Jack. I mean what is wrong with Xiomi. But sound in wired headfones are great. I guess Xiomi knows how backdated its consumers are that still they use wired headphones on mobile devices. Oher than that GPS works well, cab booking is smooth. This has one of the best battery, and I am using a black theme, hence I get almost 2.5 days backup with normal usage. (Again check your mobile connection if you have good reception. Else it will drain out in 6 hours. Don't use BSNL on 3G. That is not meant for smartphones at all.). The last thing I absolutely I hate about the this phone is why such a hugh fkng bump for the camera on the back. I mean what kind of a moronic design was that. It could have easily been at least 2 mm less in depth. So the 3 stars are for - 1. Value for money 2. Great Battery backup. 3. Fast and fluid response with working fingerprint sensor. 4. Lost on design. Too much bezle, no capacitive buttons still. 5. No Usb type C. Again I am back to checking the ports before charging.",3.0

11099,Flagship Phone at Feature Price!!!! Superb!!!,"I am very happy to get this phone in the flashsale. Used it, very happy. Pros:Light weight for a 4000mah battery phone. (Was using Note 3).Screen is good and even comparable to 50K+ phones.Finger print unlock is lightning fast. Face unlock a bit delayed, but works all time (half a second)Never felt a lag yet. (I have loaded all my apps, no high performance ones as I am not a gamer)Battery backup is awesome, I should say better than the previous versions. Even during the setup, never drained more than 10% which included updating the phone and app installations as well.Mi Mover made the change effortless, though 40% apps had to be installed separately.The soft back cover is very good and has good sticky grip. Not going for anything else.Portrait mode pictures are greatMIUI 9 is very smooth and flexible.Cons:Camera, when taking normal pictures is not up to the expectation.Charger wire is short, should have been one feet longer.Screen guard coming with this is matt finish, so had to change it to get the full advantage of the screen.Overall, I am excited and very happy with the phone. Recommend to everyone who have less than 25K budget.",5.0

The case which was bundled was of very nice quality with it's super Black colour and it's sliminess doesn't fell that you have applied a case or not and a screen protector or a tempered glass is highly recommended.

11201,Moderate,"Was ecstatic when I was able to place an order for the note 5 pro considering its probably more likely for you to win a lottery than get a phone during one of these flash sales. But this didn't last long, the phone I got was stunning in all aspect barring the magnetic sensor which didn't work for me and the sound output didn't match my expectation, don't get me wrong though I truly believe that this is a great phone at this price range but some how didn't work for me and I'm sure and hope that mine is a one off case. But the flip side of this is the return policy experience from flipkart which was exceptional, they offered a hassle free experience and also the refund was quick, so thanks flipkart for that. I still feel that one can go ahead and buy this phone as this is power paked and comes with a monster of a battery. My 3 day experience with this phone barring the defective sensor was thoroughly satisfactory. I'm giving 2 stars for this product only because of my experience with return policy.",2.0

It has got the pixels but not 100% satisfied. Hopefully these minor issues can be part of the fixes in upcoming OS releases.2. Battery life is lasting up to 24 hours( heavy usage- gaming, videos streaming) was expecting more when we have 4000 mAh battery. Assuming this will be addressed with the upcoming releases.",5.0

11299,Absolute rubbish!,There are many drawback for this phone.1. It doesn't allow dual sim and memory card support at the same time. You can either use dual sim card or one sim card and memory card.2. It's says battery is 4000 mah but doesn't last more than 14 hours if you are continuously using phone.3. Upgrade version are shown in your phone but when are trying to download it doesn't get upgraded directly from your phone.4. If you are shooting videos from back camera then it between video becomes blurr.5. It you are removing selfie from front then you will look good but if you will zoom the pics the background will not be clear.6. The lens of back camera is too much outside which damages the lens of camera if it is kept in downward direction.7. If you are browsing than suddenly internet gets disconnected and if you are updating big video in whatsapp status then phone gets error and States report error.8. MI doesn't provide earphone with phone which you will need to buy from outside .9. You cannot depend on face unlocking feature bcoz it doesn't work properly.10. I guess only side of phone is protected to gorilla glass and not the entire screen. Xiaomi hasn't mentioned the version of gorilla glass which means its screen may get damage.,1.0

11314,Mobile hanging,The phone is ok but not sooo good as they say . the finger print sensor is awesome and the performance is ok. Camera is good. I have the 6gb variant but still the phone hangs big time with all social media app running in the background and some good quality games. It been 3 months since I purchased and after all these days the device hangs big time üñïüñïüñïüñï. Also no software update . I would better' suggest you to go for the Asus max model as it's cheap and has lots of spec's better' than this and I totally forgot about the battery it says it's 4000 mah but behaves like a 1000 mah battery. My kind advice don't go for this model.,2.0

11829,Utterly Disappointed,Never buy any product from Flip kart since they are selling defective and faulty product to the customer with replacement of 10 days only. While the issue with the product arise from 12 days. Just 2 days after 10 day of returning policy. No one is coming up to help for fixing the issue nor flip kart nor Redmi. Problem with product: Getting restart again and again after all the troubleshooting step guided by the Redmi but not replacing the product. So be aware of this product seller like Flip kart or Redmi. After many conversation they are not coming up to take the responsibility of faulty product.,1.0

12959,Terrific purchase,"oh my god mobile. you don't need to read the reviews for MI mobiles. so I am not writing much . it is perfect in its all aspects. just one thing is I bought it with very high price and now it dropped almost 30%. that's why giving value for money 4 starts and all other aspects 5. go for any of this brand mobile. I have 3 different models of this brand in my family. simply awesome. I have experience with other brands HTC, Moto, Asus, Samsung and iPhone. no brand can compete with MI in terms of quality and price both. But Asus is close to MI , I have current phone Asus Mac Pro m1 only - story behind this was- my favourite MI note 5 was out of stock and Asus was giving good discount so I am very happy with Asus as well. I am writing this review after 10 months of purchase, this one was gift to the brother (mentioning so that one doesn't think that if I am not using this how can I review this.).",5.0

Was launched in Feb last year but still going strong even though 6 and 7 series is already launched.Was using the 4 Pro earlier but have to purchase a new phone after losing my beloved phone. Some competitors cropped up due to slightly higher price for the 5 Pro series but all the compitition crumbled once the prices dropped during Diwali sales. Going strong after that.Not providing any pros and cons as these are already heavily discussed and known to all.,4.0

15054,Nice,First of all the 6gb ram variant at 13k is value for money yet it had some downswings i.e1- Battery performance is not as good as expected and gets depleted easily. 4000 mah is enough for a daily use basis but it gets consumed even when the device is on standby. Im not with sure with the other phone but this one seems to drain faster than usual. 2- Reached in time as expected yet the packaging was not upto the mark it was a loose package which was discouraging for a Mi fan.3- Camera was okay not perfect but the front camera was on mark.4- USB C would have been more better rework for this phone. If not also a high adapter would have been better5- The phone is superb the touches and grip it fits well in one hand.The price is genuine enough but if there is some stability its a 5 star product. Give it a like if you guys faced the same problem.Seems minor but for a phone gig it matters :),3.0

15402,Fabulous!,"Mind blowing purchase,  After exchange with Honor 6x i got this beast (6 GB varient) for 7,800. If you compare with Note 6 pro/ note 7 pro,  this one stands out as a better option.Pros: Camera 10/10 ( Both front and rear camera are the best among the mid range smart phones) Performance 9/10 (May be overtime it may degrade but right now it's great) Display 9/10Battery 9/10 (Though the phone supports fast charging, they have not bundled it with a fast charger,  however I am still satisfied with the speed of charging.  With 30 mins charge it can charge up to 50%) Cons: - I believe MI should release all Note pro versions with Stock android out of the box,  lot of bloatware and adsOverall,  thoroughly satisfied with the phone. Hope the performance will be consistent for a longer period.",5.0

16383,Worth every penny,Firstly.. Dont go for any tampered glass.. It will take a toll on your touch.. Brilliant camera.. Perfect configuration.. No lags Or heating at all.. Iam not a much gadget freak bt there is fast charging guys.. Specifically for those who play pubg.. There are some drawbacks too..but they were just for me as I was using one plus 3 before...loved this handset guys.. Speedy delivery from flipkart and one more important thing.. As note 7 pro launched already there there should be some discount... Thank you flipkart... Love you,5.0

17199,Brilliant,"I think this is one of the most affordable devices in this range...... One plus is just a flagship brand..... And so it's double the rate of this device. Pros and plus:  The camera is insane with both rear and front... Superb clear pics. But you must know how to focus on Objects. The battery, 4000 million amp hour is pretty enough for one day of a super heavy use, u definitely need no power banks,  no chargers for a single day of heavily usage.... Trust me..... But it's lasts me more than a day cuz I'm not a heavy user...... Took on full charge 100% at 3 am and came down to 27% at ETA 11PM On a mild usage...... Very good device. The MIUI and the themes are 100 times more comfortable than the Google things. Lots of themes like coc, pubg and lots to see..... Very impressive.....The 6 gb of ram is very impressive in speed as well as smooth too. I think just one lag....... The bottom speaker is a little bit noisy while playing song..... The bass things gets a little noisy....... Rest all perfect........ Made like a gun....... If you are a pubg player,,,,, go for it, if you are not a heavy gamer,,,,, please go for it....... Thank you all for viewing..... Hit the like if you found this helpful.",5.0

It's the defect of the default camera app. You can easily remove this problem by downloading another camera app from play store. Battery backup is also awesome.

18945,Worth every penny,Special note for pubg users. I am extreme user of gaming. And specifically pubg . In the beginning pubg was running smooth for me only lags sometimes may be because of server issues or ping too. But now aftrr new updates it little but of annoying for me sometimes. But many a time (most of the time ) it runs fine. I got 6 gb ran in it. Also speed is quite good for such a price. And after extreme gaming it do not get even warmer now. In beginning it was like 45 degree while playing pubg. But now its  very normal. Reasons of the heating in the beginning wss because of developer thing.. ie they were working on fixing it bugs when it was newly launched due to some of them it got hot that time(atleast that what i think ) but as the global version released it stoped getting hot anymore. So improve d proformance of gaming too.,5.0

19070,Terrific,"This phone rocks even in 2019. Even after the launch of RN6Pro. Reasons to buy it even in 2019: 1. PRICE. No other phone can be as bang for the buck as this is at ‚Çπ11234 for a 6GB Ram variant.2. No kilometer wide notch nonsense. 3. One of the most popular phone in the market. You get all the accessories at the best price in the market,  even from a smallest shop in the corner of your city.4. Great build quality, unlike phones with plastic backs. 5. MI service center availability. 6. Doesn't skip on any major sensors. Great display quality, build, camera, and battery.The list is endless. One advantage of going for this phone is, it's unworthy successor is in market. And Xiaomi is looking to increase the sales of their latest model by reducing this phone's price, which comes with same hardware, and 1 camera less in the front.",5.0

19390,Just wow!,"Phone is decent in look-wise. Slim Metal body gives premium feel. Camera is very good in day light, Portrait mode works perfectly fine. Picture quality is also decent but camera performance is average in low light.Phone with 6 GB variant works fast and did not felt so for any lagging or heating issues. I would recommend while charging use Airplane mode it bump up charging speed for a reason. You need to wear a silicon cover on Phone for better grip because its sleepery. I accidentally dropped in water, phone speaker stopped working but after a day keeping under light. It's working fine.Screen is nice I did not felt any difference as I used Redmi devices previously except sharpness and quality. Except everything is same with previous Redmi devices. Face unlock is fast but not accurate. New MIUI 10 update is not stable phone get stuck sometime at any screen for while and need to reboot, sometimes. Worth to buy this phone under Rs 15000/-",5.0

19617,Brilliant,"Summary of my initial reaction first week of usage: 1. Build and design:  Sturdy,  great in hand feel, black looks and feels awesome.  10/10.2. Audio via speaker just the perfect loudness.  10/10.3. Audio via earphones with MI sound enhancer setting switched on:  10/10.4. Performance:  Swift and snappy,  a seamless and well optimized MIUI 10/10.5. Call quality excellent 10/10.6. Rear Camera Very good.  8/10.7. Front camera Excellent 9/10.8. Our of 6 gb RAM 4.1 GB is available which is great. At the present price of RS 13999/ the 6 GB variant is an absolute steal. Just go for it for a purchase which will never disappoint you  Only con in my opinion is the hybrid SIM slot but with the 64 GB you will surely not need it.  You can keep a OTG pen drive to transfer and save additional media content if necessary. It is a perfect all rounder device.",5.0
